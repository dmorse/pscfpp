===================

The following namespace names are used below to label changes that effect only 
particular programs or sets of programs, each of which is defined in the specifiec 
namespace:

   Pspc - CPU pseudo-spectral code for periodic structures
   Pspg - GPU pseudo-spectral code for periodic structures
   Fd1d - Finite element code for one-dimension (1D) problems


Pscf++ v0.8.1
==============

- Fixed an error in instructions for modifying PYTHONPATH environment
  variable (github issue #64)


Pscf++ v0.8.0
==============

Released March 11, 2022

* Point-particle solvent (Fd1d, Pspc, and Pspg)
* Open ensembles (grand canonical or mixed) in AmIterator (Pspc and Pspg)
* Allow grids with node counts that are not factors of 2 in Pspg

User-visible changes
--------------------
