= PSCF (C++/CUDA) History  =
============================

This file documents changes to the C++/CUDA version of PSCF. Source code 
for this project is in the dmorse/pscfpp github.com repository.

The following labels are used below to indicate which programs or sets of
programs are affected by specific changes:

  pc  - CPU code for periodic structures (pscf_pc)
  pg  - GPU code for periodic structures (pscf_pg)
  1d  - CPU finite difference code for 1D problems (pscf_1d)
  all - all programs (1d, pc, and pg)

Versions before v1.2 used program name pscf_fd and label fd for the 1D 
finite difference SCFT code that is now called pscf_1d.
