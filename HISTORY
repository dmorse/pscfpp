= PSCF (C++/CUDA) History  =
============================

This file documents changes to the C++/CUDA version of PSCF. Source code 
for this project is in the dmorse/pscfpp github.com repository.

The following labels are used below to indicate which programs or sets of
programs are affected by specific changes:

  pc  - CPU code for periodic structures (pscf_pc)
  pg  - GPU code for periodic structures (pscf_pg)
  1d  - CPU finite difference code for 1D problems (pscf_1d)
  all - all programs (1d, pc, and pg)

Versions before v1.2 use program name pscf_fd and label fd for the 1D
finite difference SCFT code that is now called pscf_1d.

Version 1.2.0 (4/14/2025)
=========================================

User-visible features
---------------------
* Stochastic field theoretic simulation (FTS) using real-valued fields 
  and a partial saddle-point approximation (PS-FTS) in programs with
  periodic boundary conditions (pc, pg)

  Implementation of PS-FTS includes:

   - Brownian Dynamics (BD) and Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations

   - MC Moves: Real-space and Force-bias/"Smart" MC moves
   - Efficient "Compressor" algorithms to find partial saddle-points
   - "Analyzer" classes to measure structure factor and other observables
   - Tools for creating and postprocessing field trajectory files
   - Continuous variation ("Ramp") of one or more parameters

   - Einstein-crystal method of free energy calculation

* Addition of confinement, external fields and thin films to the pscf_pg
  GPU code (pg)

  increasing the number of spatial dimensions (e.g., create a 1D lamellar 
  of 2D hexagonal phase in 3D), or scaling fields by a constant (pc, pg).
