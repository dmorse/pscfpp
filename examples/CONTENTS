Different subdirectories of this examples/ directory contain examples of 
calculations that use different PSCF programs:

  Directory    Program     Description
  ---------    --------    -------------
   1d/         pscf_1d     one-dimensional (CPU)
   pc/         pscf_pc     periodic  (CPU)
   pg/         pscf_pg     periodic  (GPU)

Top level subdirectories of 1d/, pc/, and pg/ each contain examples
for different types of physical systems, e.g., subdirectory pc/diblock/ 
contains examples for periodic phases of diblock copolymer melts. 

Most example directories contain an executable file named "run" that can 
be used to run the example, by invoking "./run".
