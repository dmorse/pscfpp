 The files in this directory contain fragments of the configuration files
 that are installed by the setup script in the src/, and bld/ directories.

 Files in the make/config directory contain source files for the main
 makefile and the namespace level makefiles that are installed in each
 build directory by the setup script. 

 Each file in the make/compiler directory contains a set of makefile
 definitions that are appropriate to a particular combination of compiler, 
 mpi library, and operating system environment. The contents of one of
 these files is incorporated into the main config.mk file in each build
 directory by the setup script. The default choice is the "gcc" file.
 The name of a different choice can be passed to the setup script as 
 a command line argument. For example, invoke "./setup intel" to use 
 the definitions given in the file make/compiler/intel.
