# Compiler configuration file section:
#
# The block of variable definitions that follows this explanation is 
# initialized by the configure script by copying the contents of a 
# compiler configuration file found in the make/compiler director into
# the main config.mk files in the src/ and bld/ directories. The file
# "make/compiler/default" is used by default.  Users may add files to
# the make/compiler directory to store customized settings. If the
# configure script is invoked with a filename argument (e.g., as
# "./configure local"), the file in the make/compiler directory with
# the specified name (e.g., make/compiler/local) is used as the compiler
# configuration file and copied into the main config.mk files.
#
# Variables defined in this block define the names of commands used to
# to invoke compilers and linkers, some of the standard command line 
# options passed to the compiler, and search paths for header files and 
# libraries files for required external libraries.  See the section of 
# this file entitled "Makefile Patterns and Recipes" below for a 
# discussion of how these variables are used.
#
# The definitions given in make/compiler/default are designed to work on 
# most linux systems. They assume that:
#
#   - The command g++ is used to invoke the C++ compiler.
#   - The command nvcc is used to invoke the nvidia cuda compiler (if any)
#   - Header files and libraries for the CUDA and FFTW libraries are in
#     directories in standard compiler search paths.
#   - The gsl-config command can be used by the configure script to find the
#     header and library paths for the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL).
#
# These definitions also work for Mac OSX environments with an Intel CPU
# and unix command line tools installed (for which the g++ command invokes 
# the clang compiler) when the homebrew package manager was used to install 
# the GSL and FFTW libraries. The installation locations used by homebrew
# on Macs with Intel CPUs are consistent with those used by linux (while
# the locations used by Homebrew on a Mac with Apple ARM CPUs are not).
