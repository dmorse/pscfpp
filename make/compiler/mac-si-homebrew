# Compiler configuration file section:
#
# The block of variable definitions that follows this explanation is 
# initialized by the configure script by copying the contents of a 
# compiler configuration file found in the make/compiler director into
# the main config.mk files in the src/ and bld/ directories. The file
# "make/compiler/default" is used by default.  Users may add files 
# to the make/compiler directory to store customized settings. If 
# the configure script is invoked with a filename argument (e.g., as
# "./configure local"), the file in the make/compiler directory with
# the specified name (e.g., make/compiler/local) is used as the compiler
# configuration file and copied into the main config.mk files.
#
# Variables defined in this block define the names of commands used to
# to invoke compilers and linkers, some of the standard command line 
# options passed to the compiler, and search paths for header files and 
# libraries files for required external libraries.  See the section of 
# this file entitled "Makefile Patterns and Recipes" below for a 
# discussion of how these variables are used.
#
# The definitions given below are designed for use on a Mac OS X
# running on Mac silicon (e.g., the m1 or m2 ARM chip), using the homebrew
# package manager to install the GSL and FFTW libraries. They assume:
#
#   - The command g++ can be used to invoke the C++ compiler (though 
#     g++ may be an alias for the Apple installed Clang compiler)
#   - Header files and libraries for FFTW are in a subdirectory of the
#     /opt/homebrew directory
#   - The gsl-config command can be used by the configure script to
#     find the correct header and library paths for the Gnu Scientific
#     Library (GSL)
#
# Note: The default compiler configuration file can be used to compile
# on a Mac that uses an Intel CPU and the homebrew package manager, 
# because of  a difference in how homebrew is configured machines that 
# use intel and apple CPUss: Homebrew installs in /usr/local for Intel 
# silicon and in /opt/homebrew for Apple silicon.
