# file: $(BLD_DIR)/config.mk
#
# This makefile fragment is the main configuration file for the pscf
# build system.  A copy of this file is included by all other makefiles. 
# This file is installed by the "configure" script, and may be edited by
# the user if needed. Copies of this file are installed in the src/
# directory and in the bld/ directory. The copy in the src/ directory
# controls in-source compilation, in which intermediate files are created
# in the root directory tree, and the copy in the bld/ directory controls
# out-of-source compilation in which these files are installed in the bld/
# directory.
#
# This file contains definitions of several types of makefile variables:
# 
#  - Variables ROOT_DIR, SRC_DIR, BLD_DIR, BIN_DIR and DAT_DIR define
#    absolute paths for the pscfpp/ root directory and some of its 
#    subdirectories.
#
#  - A variable UTIL_DEBUG that, if defined, enables compilation of 
#    debugging version of all source files with additional sanity checks.
#
#  - A variable PSCF_OPENMP that, if defined, enables OpenMP in C++ code.
#
#  - A variable PSCF_CUDA that, if defined, enables building of CUDA code.
#
#  - Variables that control the name for C++ and C++/CUDA compilers,
#    and command line options passed to both compilers.
# 
#  - Variable MAKEDEP and MAKEDEP_CUDA that give names for scripts used
#    to automatically generate dependency (*.d) files.
#
#=========================================================================
# Variables that define absolute directory paths
#
# In the config.mk file installed in each build directory (src/ or bld/), 
# values of these variables are set by the configure script, and should
# usually not need to be modified by users.

# Absolute path to the pscfpp/ root directory
ROOT_DIR=PWD

# Path to the build directory (location for intermediate generated files)
# This should be the directory that contains this config.mk file
BLD_DIR=$(ROOT_DIR)/=OWD

# Path to the source directory (contains C++ source code files)
SRC_DIR=$(ROOT_DIR)/src

# Installation directory for executable files
BIN_DIR=$(ROOT_DIR)/bin

# Directory for shared permanent (read-only) data used by programs.
DAT_DIR=$(ROOT_DIR)/data

#======================================================================
# Conditional compilation of debugging.

# Defining UTIL_DEBUG enables extra run-time validity tests.
#UTIL_DEBUG=1

# Note: The setopts script may be used to uncomment or comment out this
# definition of UTIL_DEBUG , by entering "./setopts -d1" to enable 
# debugging (uncomment) or "./setopts -d0" to disable (comment out).
#======================================================================
# Conditional compilation of C++ with OpenMP 
 
# Defining PSCF_OPENMP enables compilation of C++ with OpenMP.
#PSCF_OPENMP=1
 
# Note: The setopts script may be used to uncomment or comment out this
# definition of PSCF_OPENMP, by entering "./setopts -m1" to enable OpenMP
# (uncomment PSCF_OPENMP=1) or "./setopts -m0" to disable (comment out).
#======================================================================
# Conditional compilation of CUDA code
 
# Defining PSCF_CUDA enables compilation of CUDA code.
#PSCF_CUDA=1
 
# Note: The setopts script may be used to uncomment or comment out this
# definition of PSCF_CUDA, by entering "./setopts -c1" to enable CUDA
# (uncomment PSCF_CUDA=1) or "./setopts -c0" to disable (comment out).
