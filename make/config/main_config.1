# file: $(BLD_DIR)/config.mk
#
# This makefile fragment is the main configuration file for the pscfpp
# build system.  A copy of this file is included by all other makefiles. 
# This file is created and installed by the "setup" script. One copy of 
# this file is installed in the src/ directory, which is used for in-source 
# compilation. Two others copies are created in the root directories of 
# the bld/parallel and bld/serial build directory trees, which are used for
# out-of-source compilation of parallel and serial programs respectively.
#
#=========================================================================
# This file contains user-modifiable definitions of several types of 
# makefile variables:
# 
#  - Variables ROOT_DIR, SRC_DIR, BLD_DIR and BIN_DIR that contains 
#    absolute paths for the simpatico root directory and some of its
#    subdirectories.
#
#  - Variables UTIL_MPI, UTIL_DEBUG, and UTIL_CXX11 that, if defined
#    enabled conditional compilation of optional features of the code.
#
#  - Environment-dependent variabes that control the command name by
#    which the compiler is invoked and some compiler command line options.
# 
#  - A variable MAKEDEP that enables automatic dependency generation.
#
#=========================================================================
# Variables that define absolute directory paths
#
# In the config.mk file installed in each build directory, correct
# values of these variables should have been set by the setup script,
# and should not need to modified by the user.

# Absolute path to the root simpatico directory
ROOT_DIR=PWD

# Path to the build directory (location for intermediate generated files)
# This should also be the directory that contains this script.
BLD_DIR=$(ROOT_DIR)/=OWD

# Path to the source directory (contains C++ source code files)
SRC_DIR=$(ROOT_DIR)/src

# Installation directory for binary executable program files
BIN_DIR=$(ROOT_DIR)/bin

# Directory for shared permanent (read-only) data used by programs.
DAT_DIR=$(ROOT_DIR)/data

#======================================================================
# Variables that (if defined) enable compilation of optional features

# Defining UTIL_DEBUG enables a variety of extra sanity checks, at some
# cost in speed. Debugging is disabled (commented out) by default.
#UTIL_DEBUG=1

# Defining UTIL_CXX11 enables the use of features of the C++11 standard.
# Use of C++11 is enabled by default. If C++11 is disabled, the code uses 
# only syntax and features defined in the older 1998 C++ standard.
UTIL_CXX11=1

# Defining UTIL_MPI enables linking to an MPI library. MPI must be
# enabled by uncommenting this line to build a parallel program.
#UTIL_MPI=1

# Comment After setup, the above definitions of UTIL_DEBUG and UTIL_MPI
# may be uncommented or commented out invoking the "configure" script 
# from the build directory that contains this file, thus enabling or 
# disabling the MPI or and/or debugging features.  Specifically, the 
# configure script may be be invoked with option -m to enable 
# (option -m1) or disable (-m0) MPI, and with option -g to enable 
# (-g1) or disable (-g0) debugging. For example, the command:
#
# ./configure -m1 -g0 
#
# would enable MPI (uncomment the definition of UTIL_MPI) and disable 
# debugging (comment out the definition of UTIL_DEGUB) prior to 
# compilation. 
#
#======================================================================
# Environment-dependent makefile variables.
#
# Variables defined in this block define the names of the commands 
# used to invoke the compiler when compiling and linking files and 
# some of the command line options passed to the compiler to control,
# e.g., optimization level, warnings, and search paths for header files 
# and libraries. Different choices may be used when compiling serial 
# programs (when UTIL_MPI is not defined) or parallel programs (when
# UTIL_MPI is defined). The choice of values of variables defined here 
# may thus be different for different combinations of compiler, MPI
# library and operating system.  See the section of this file 
# entitled "Makefile Patterns and Recipes" for a discussion of how
# these variables are used.
#
# The following block of variable definitions is copied by the setup
# script from a compiler setup file in the make/compiler directory
# and incorporated into this config.mk file. The name of the desired 
# compiler setup file may be specified as an argument to the setup 
# script command (e.g., "> ./setup intel").
