#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# This makefile fragment defines:
#
#   - A variable $(UTIL_DEFS) that is passed to the processor to define 
#     preprocessor flags that effect the code in the util/ directory. 
#
#   - A variable $(UTIL_MPI_SUFFIX) that is set to "_m" if MPI is enabled
#     and left undefined otherwise. This is added as a suffix to the name
#     of the util library.
#
#   - A variable $(UTIL_SUFFIX) that can be used (optionally) to indicates 
#     what other features are enabled, which is added after UTIL_MPI_SUFFIX 
#     to the file name of util library. By default, this is an empty string.
#
#   - A variable $(UTIL_LIB) that the absolute path to the util library 
#     file.
#
# This file must be included by every makefile in the util directory. 
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Flag to define preprocessor macros.

# The variables UTIL_MPI, UTIL_DEBUG, and UTIL_CXX11 used in this file
# must defined (or not not defined) in the main config.mk file.

# Most users will not need to modify the rest of this file. 
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Comments:
#
# The variable UTIL_DEFS is used to pass preprocessor definitions to
# the compiler, using the "-D" compiler option. If not empty, it must 
# consist of a list of zero or more preprocessor macro names, each 
# preceded by the compiler flag "-D".  For example, setting UTIL_DEFS 
# to "-DUTIL_MPI -DUTIL_DEBUG" will cause compilation of a parallel
# version of the code with debugging enabled.
#
# The variable UTIL_SUFFIX is appended to the base name util.a of the 
# static library $(UTIL_LIB).  By default, this is an empty string, 
# but users may uncomment lines that add to this string in order to 
# enable the addition of suffixes to file names to indicate which 
# compile-time features are enabled. For example, uncommenting the
# line that adds the suffix "_g" when debugging is enabled will cause
# the make system, in the absence of other options, to create a static
# library named utillib_g.a rather than utillib.a in the util/ directory.
#
# The variable UTIL_DEFS is a recursive (normal) makefile variable, and
# may be extended using the += operator, e.g., UTIL_DEFS+=-DUTIL_DEBUG.
# UTIL_SUFFIX is instead a non-recursive makefile variable, which may 
# be extended using the := operator, as UTIL_SUFFIX:=$(UTIL_SUFFIX)_g. 
# They are defined differently because the += operator for recursive
# variables adds a white space before an added string, which is 
# appropriate for UTIL_DEFS, but not for UTIL_SUFFIX. 
 
# Initialize macros to empty strings
