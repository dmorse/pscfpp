This directory contains C++ and C++/CUDA code used by a GPU-accelerated
program pscf_pg for self-consistent field theory (SCFT) and field theoretic
simulation (FTS) with real fields and periodic boundary conditions.  All 
FTS algorithms implemented in this directory rely on a partial saddle point
approximation (PS-FTS).  Code in this directory are generally very closely 
analogous to that in the src/rpc directory, which is used to construct the 
analogous pscf_pc CPU program.

All classes and functions defined in this directory are in namespace 
Pscf::Rpg.  The name Rpg stands for 'real periodic GPU'. Code in namespace
Rpg may use classes and functions defined in namespace Util (or directory 
src/util), namespace Pscf::Prdc (directory src/prdc/), or namespace 
Pscf::Prdc::Cuda (or src/prdc/cuda). Many header and source code files in 
this directory contain "using namespace" expressions that allow names from 
the Util, Pscf::Prdc and Pscf::Prdc::Cuda namespaces to be used without
explicit namespace qualifiers.
