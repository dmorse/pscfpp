\page rpg_AmIteratorBasis_page Rpg::AmIteratorBasis

The Rpg::AmIteratorBasis iterator used by the pscf_pg programs is closely
analogous to the \ref rpc_AmIteratorBasis_page "Rpc::AmIteratorBasis" 
iterator used by the pscf_pc programs. Both classes use a formulation of
the Anderson mixing algorithm in which both the residual vector and the
vector of unknowns are defined using symmetry-adapted Fourier expansions 
of all underlying fields.  Both algorithm can be used to either solve the 
SCFT equations for a rigid unit cell or to solve the SCFT equations and 
also optimize the unit cell parameters of a flexible unit cell so as to 
minimize the free energy density.

The format of the associated parameter block is identical to that used by 
the corresponding pscf_pc algorithm, and is described more formally below:
\code
AmIteratorBasis{
   epsilon        real 
   maxItr*        int (200 by default)
   maxHist*       int (50 by default0
   verbose*       int (0-2, 0 by default)
   outputTime*    bool (false by default)
   errorType*     string ("norm", "rms", "max", or "relNorm", "relNorm" by default)
   isFlexible*    bool (0 or 1, 1 by default)   
   scaleStress*   real (10.0 by default)
}
\endcode
Here, as elsewhere, labels followed by an asterisk (*) represent optional 
parameters. The meaning of the various parameters are described below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> <b> Label </b>  </td>
    <td> <b> Description </b>  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> epsilon </td>
    <td> Error tolerance for convergence - iteration stops if the
         magnitude of the scalar error becomes less than epsilon
         (Required)  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> maxItr* </td>
    <td> Maximum number of iterations that will be attempted 
         (Optional, 200 by default) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> maxHist* </td>
    <td> Maximum number of previous trial solultions that will be 
         retained in memory for used by the AM algorithm
         (Optional, 50 by default) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> verbose* </td>
    <td> Integer level 0, 1, 2 for verbosity of log output during iteration.
         Lower values are more concise.
         (Optional, 0 by default) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> showTime* </td>
    <td> Set to 1 (true) to report wall clock time components in log file
         (Optional, false by default) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> errorType* </td>
    <td> Identifer for the type of residual norm used to define scalar error. 
         The allowed values are "norm", "rms", "max", and "relNorm", as 
         discussed \ref pscf_AmIteratorTmpl_page "here". 
         (Optional, and equal to "relNorm" by default) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> isFlexible* </td>
    <td> Set isFlexible true to enable or false to disable iterative 
         optimization of the unit cell parameters so as to minimize the 
         free energy. (Optional, true by default)  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> scaleStress* </td>
    <td> Constant factor by which stress components are multipled in
         the definition of the residual  attempted if isFlexible is
         true (optional, 10.0 by default). </td>
  </tr>
</table>
The iterative loop exits if the number of iterations has reaches
maxItr or if the magnitude of the scalar error drops below epsilon. 

The Rpg::AmIteratorBasis class is nearly identical to the corresponding
Rpc::AmIteratorBasis class used by the pscf_pc program. The same 
definition of the the residual vector is used in both classes.  Please 
see the documentation of the Rpc \ref rpc_AmIteratorBasis_page 
"AmIteratorBasis" class for the residual definition and some other 
details.
