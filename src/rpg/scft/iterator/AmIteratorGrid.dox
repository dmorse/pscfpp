The AmIteratorGrid iterator used by the pscf_pg programs uses an 
Anderson mixing algorithm in which residual equations and field updates
are formulated using values defined on the nodes of a regular spatial
grid. The algorithm can be used to either solve the SCFT equations for 
a rigid unit cell or to solve the SCFT equations and also optimize the 
unit cell parameters of a flexible unit cell so as to minimize the free 
energy density.

The format of the associated parameter block is identical to that used
by AmIteratorBasis, as described below:
\code
AmIterator{
   epsilon        real 
   maxItr*        int (200 by default)
   maxHist*       int (50 by default0
   verbose*       int (0-2, 0 by default)
   outputTime*    bool (false by default)
   errorType*     string ("norm", "rms", "max", or "relNorm", "relNorm" by default)
   isFlexible*    bool (0 or 1, 0/false by default)   
   scaleStress*   real (10.0 by default)
}
\endcode
Here, as elsewhere, labels followed by an asterisk (*) represent optional 
parameters. The meaning of the various parameters are described below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> <b> Label </b>  </td>
    <td> <b> Description </b>  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> epsilon </td>
    <td> Desired tolerance for convergence - iteration stops if 
         the magnitude of the error drops below epsilon.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> maxItr* </td>
    <td> Maximum number of iterations that will be attempted 
         (200 by default) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> maxHist* </td>
    <td> Maximum number of previous trial solultions that will be 
         retained in memory for used by the AM algorithm 
         (50 by default) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> verbose* </td>
    <td> Integer level 0-2 for verbosity of log output during iteration.
         Optional, and 0 (concise) by default. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> showTime* </td>
    <td> Set to 1 (true) to report wall clock time components in log file. 
         Optional, and 0 (false) by default. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> errorType* </td>
    <td> String identifer for the type of variable used to define scalar
         error . The only allowed values are "norm", "rms", "max", and
         "relNorm". Optional, set to "relNorm" by default. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> isFlexible* </td>
    <td> Set isFlexible true to enable or false to disable iterative 
         optimization of the unit cell parameters so as to minimize the
         free energy. Optional and set 1/true by default.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> scaleStress* </td>
    <td> Constant factor by which stress components are multipled in
         the definition of the residual vector if isFlexible is true 
         (10.0 by default). </td>
  </tr>
</table>
The iterative loop exits if the number of iterations has reaches
maxItr or if the magnitude of the scalar error drops below epsilon. 

The Rpg::AmIteratorGrid uses a definition of the residual vector that 
analogous to that used by Rpg::AmIteratorBasis and Rpc::AmIterator, 
except that residal components associated with errors in the SCF
equations are defined as components of the relevant difference in
fields at particular grid points, rather than components of these
differences in a Fourier-adapated Fourier series. One result of 
this difference is that the magnitude of erors obtained for 
corresponding states with the same errorType flag will generally be 
different (sometimes very different) for the AmIteratorGrid and 
AmIteratorBasis programs. See the documentation for the Rpc
\ref rpc_AmIteratorBasis_page "kAmIteratorBasis" algorithm for the 
definition fo the residual field and some other details.
