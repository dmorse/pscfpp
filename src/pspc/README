This directory contains code specific to a pseudo-spectral implementation 
of SCFT for periodic structures.  All code in this directory is defined in 
the namespace Pscf::Pspc.  Algorithms are generally analogous to those used 
in the older Fortran PSCF code.  

Main Programs:

Users must invoke different executable files for problems involving 
structures that are periodic in different numbers of dimensions. 
The executable programs for 1, 2 and 3 dimensionally periodic structures 
are named pscf_pc1d, and pscf_pc2d and pscf_pc3d, respectively.  
Examples of the usage of these programs are provided in the directory 
pscfpp/examples/pspc/diblock.

The usual command line usage for doing a 3D SCFT calculation (e.g., 
the one in directory examples/pspc/diblock/bcc) is to invoke

     pscf_pc3d -e -p param -c command

from the directory containing the files "param" and "command". Here, 
"param" denotes the name of a parameter file and "command" denotes 
the name of a command file.  The -e option causes the parameter file to 
be echoed to standard output as it is read.  To perform a 2D (e.g., a 
hexagonal phase) or 1D calculation (a lamellar phase), one would 
instead invoke the executable pscf_ps2d or pscf_ps1d, respectively. 

See the html documentation for information about the format of the
parameter and command files.
