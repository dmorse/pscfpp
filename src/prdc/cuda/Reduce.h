/** 
* Functions that perform parallel reductions on the GPU. 
* 
* A reduction is any operation that involves reducing all of the 
* elements of an array (or a set of multiple arrays) down to a single 
* result. Examples include taking the sum or finding the maximum of 
* all array elements. Highly efficient algorithms have been developed 
* to perform such operations in parallel on a GPU, and those 
* algorithms are implemented here.
* 
* A kernel wrapper is provided for each reduction operation, which
* takes a DeviceArray as an input and returns a single value. The 
* wrappers are called on the host, and they call CUDA kernels 
* internally to perform the reductions in parallel.
* 
* The CUDA kernels that perform the parallel reductions are not 
* intended to be called directly. The wrappers and CUDA kernels are 
* implemented together in a way that optimizes the speed of the 
* overall operation. To do this, several important aspects of the
* algorithm are performed by the wrapper, detailed further below.
* 
* First, the CUDA kernels do not perform the entire reduction. 
* Rather, each block of threads in the GPU is reduced to a single 
* value, and the kernel returns an array containing one value for 
* each thread block. The kernel wrapper then performs the remaining 
* reduction by either calling the kernel again or performing the
* remaining reduction on the host, depending on the size of the 
* array output by the first kernel. Once the array is smaller than
* 1e5 elements, the remaining reduction is performed on the CPU. 
* (This value is chosen because the GPU does not significantly speed 
* up reductions on arrays smaller than 1e5 elements.)
* 
* Second, the CUDA kernels are designed to use a number of threads
* that is only half the size of the input array (rounded up to the 
* nearest multiple of the thread block size). The kernel wrapper 
* properly determines the GPU configuration before calling the kernel.
