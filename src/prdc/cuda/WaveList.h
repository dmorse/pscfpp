   * Class to calculate and store properties of wavevectors.
   *
   * In particular, minimum images, square norms of wavevectors (kSq), and
   * derivatives of the square norms of wavevectors with respect to the
   * lattice parameters (dKSq) are calculated and stored by this class.
   * 
   * Any time the lattice parameters change the clearUnitCellData() method
   * should be called, which will effectively reset the WaveList object so
   * that the wavevector properties will need to be recalculated before
   * being used.
   * 
   * This object calculates these wavevector properties for a mesh of grid
   * points in k-space. If a calculation only requires real-valued fields, 
   * PSCF uses a reduced-size k-space mesh, as output by cuFFT. However, a 
   * full-sized k-space mesh (the same size as the real-space mesh) is 
   * necessary when dealing with complex-valued fields. The k-space mesh
   * used by a WaveList object is determined by the parameter isRealField,
   * which is assigned in the constructor and cannot later be changed.
