   * Tool for conversion of fields to a basis in composition space.

   * in a real vector space of dimension nMonomer, where nMonomer is the
   * number of monomer types.  This class provides functions that can
   * convert between a list of fields associated with different monomer 
   * types to a corresponding list of field components that are each
   * associated with a vector in such a basis. 
   * 
   * This class is designed primarily for use in field theory simulations 
   * in which it useful to define field components associated with
   * eigenvectors of an nMonomer x nMonomer symmetric matrix that 
   * describes interactions among monomers of different types.
