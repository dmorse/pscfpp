   /**
   * Container for a field to which the total density is constrained.
   * 
   * Partial specializations of MaskTmpl \<D, FieldIo, RField\> are used 
   * as base classes for Rpc::Mask \<D \> and Rpg::Mask \<D\>.
   *
   * A system that contains a Mask must satisfy a modified version of the
   * incompressibility constraint, in which the sum of the concentration
   * fields of all monomer types must be equal to the Mask field. The Mask 
   * field takes values in the range [0, 1] everywhere. A system without a 
   * Mask is equivalent to a system in which the mask field is equal to 1 
   * at all points in the unit cell.
   * 
   * A Mask \<D\> contains representations of this field in two formats:
   * 
   *  - A DArray \<double\> that contains components of the field in a
   *    symmetry-adapted Fourier expansion (i.e., in basis format). This 
   *    is accessed by the basis() member function.
   *
   *  - An RField object (where RField is a template parameter) contains 
   *    values of the field on the nodes of a regular mesh. This is 
   *    accessed by the rgrid() member function.
   *
   * A Mask is designed to automatically update one of these 
   * representations when the other is modified, when appropriate. 
   * A pointer to an associated FieldIo (another template class) is used 
   * for these conversions. The FieldIo class that is used to instantiate
   * this template should be a subclass of Prdc::FieldIoReal.
   * 
   * The setBasis function allows the user to input new components in
   * basis format and internally recomputes the values in r-grid format.
   * The setRgrid function allows the user to reset the field in r-grid
   * format, but recomputes the components in basis format if and only
   * if the user explicitly declares that the field are known to be
   * invariant under all symmetries of the space group. A boolean member
   * variable named isSymmetric is used to keep track of whether the 
   * current mask field is symmetric, and thus whether the basis format 
   * exists.
   *
   * <b> Signal </b>: A WContainerReal owns an instance of class
   * Util::Signal<void> that notifies all observers whenever the fields
   * owned by the WContainerReal are modified. The signal object may be 
   * accessed by reference using the signal() member function, and the
   * Util::Signal<void>::addObserver function may used to add observer 
   * objects and indicate a zero-parameter member function of each 
   * observer that will be called whenever the fields are modified.
