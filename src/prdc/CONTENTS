The src/prdc directory contains source code for treating systems with
periodic boundary conditions. 

All source code in this directory is defined in namespace Pscf::Prdc, 
and may use classes and functions defined in namespace Util (directory
src/util) or parent namespace Pscf (directory src/pscf).  Code in the
Pscf::Prdc namespace may be used throughout the Pscf::Rpc and Pscf::Rpg 
namespaces (directories src/rpc and src/rpg) to construct the 
corresponding pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs for systems with periodic 
boundary conditions. 

Subdirectories:
---------------

  crystal/     - unit cells, space groups, and symmetry adapted basis
  cpu/         - field containers etc. for CPU, only used in pscf_pc
  cuda/        - field containers etc. for GPU, only used in pscf_pg
  environment/ - generation of imposed mask and external fields
  field/       - shared base classes and utilities for fields (CPU & GPU)
  iterator/    - tools and base classes for iterators
  tests/       - unit tests for code in src/prdc

Enclosed namespaces:
--------------------

  - Code in prdc/cpu is in enclosed namespace Pscf::Prdc::Cpu
  - Code in prdc/cuda is in enclosed namespace Pscf::Prdc::Cuda

  Namespaces Pscf::Prdc::Cpu and Pscf::Prdc::Cuda contain analogous
  definitions of classes that are designed for use on code that runs
  on a Cpu and for code that uses CUDA to use an NVIDIA GPU, respectively. 
  Analogous classes in these namespaces generally have the same name.
  For example, each defines a class template named RField that stores 
  data for a real-valued field defined on a grid. The memory used by 
  class Pscf::Prdc::Cpu::RField is allocated on the CPU while memory 
  used by class Pscf::Prdc::Cuda::RField is allocated on the GPU.  
  Names defined in Pscf::Prdc::Cpu are used in namespace Pscf::Rpc to 
  construct program pscf_pc, whereas names defined in Pscf::Prdc::Gpu
  are used in namespace Pscf::Rpg to construct program pscf_pg.

Makefile and makefile fragments:
--------------------------------

makefile     - main makefile for src/prdc directory tree
sources.mk   - list of source files in src/prdc (makefile fragment)
patterns.mk  - pattern rules for use in src/prdc (makefile fragment)
include.mk   - makefile include statements (makefile fragment)

Doxygen documentation file:
---------------------------

prdc.mod     - definition of Pscf_Prdc_Module doxygen topics module
