   * Solver for a mixture of polymers and solvents.
   *
   * A Mixture contains a list of Polymer and Solvent objects. Each such
   * object can solve the single-molecule statistical mechanics problem
   * for an ideal gas of the associated species in a set of specified
   * chemical potential fields, and thereby compute concentrations and
   * and single-molecule partition functions. A Mixture is thus both a
   * a chemistry descriptor and an ideal-gas solver.
   *
   * The single-molecule partition functions and concentrations for a
   * non-interacting mixture of polymer and solvent species are computed
   * by invoking the Mixture::compute function.  The Mixture::compute 
   * function takes an arrays of monomer chemical potential fields 
   * (w fields) as an input argument and an array of monomer concentration 
   * fields (c fields) as an output. 
   *
   * A Mixture is associated with a Mesh<D> object, which models a spatial
   * discretization mesh, and a UnitCell<D> object, which describes the
   * periodic unit cell. The Mixture::clearUnitCellData function clears
   * parameters that depend on the unit cell as invalid, and must be called
   * once after every time the unit cell parameters are set or modified, 
   * before the next call to Mixture::compute.
