This directory contains code used in program pscf_pc for self-consistent
field theory (SCFT) and field theoretic simulations (FTS) with real fields 
and periodic boundary conditions, using conventional CPU hardware.  All 
stochastic FTS algorithms implemented in this directory rely on a partial 
saddle point approximation (PS-FTS), which allows the use of real fields. 

All code in this directory (src/rpc) is defined in the C++ namespace 
Pscf::Rpc. The symbol Rpc stands for 'real periodic CPU'. Code defined in
namespace Pscf::Rpc may use classes and functions defined in namespace 
Util (directory src/util), parent namespace Pscf (directory src/pscf), 
namespace Pscf::Prdc (directory src/prdc) and namespace Pscf::Prdc::Cpu
(directory src/prdc/cpu). Source files in src/rpc contain 
"using namespace ..." statements that allow names of classes and functions
defined in namespaces Util, Pscf::Prdc, and Pscf::Prdc::Cpu to be used 
without explicit namespace qualifiers.
