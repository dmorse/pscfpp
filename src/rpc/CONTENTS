This directory contains code used in program pscf_pc for self-consistent
field theory (SCFT) and field theoretic simulations (FTS) with real fields 
and periodic boundary conditions, using conventional CPU hardware.  All 
stochastic FTS algorithms implemented in this directory rely on a partial 
saddle point approximation (PS-FTS), which allows the use of real fields. 

All classes and functions defined in this directory (src/rpc) are in 
namespace Pscf::Rpc. The name Rpc stands for 'real periodic CPU'. Code 
defined in this namespace may use classes and functions defined in 
namespace Util (directory src/util), namespace Pscf::Prdc (directory 
src/prdc) and namespace Pscf::Prdc::Cpu (directory src/prdc/cpu). Many
source files in src/rpc contain "using namespace ..." statements that 
allow names from namespaces Util, Pscf::Prdc, and Pscf::Prdc::Cpu to be 
used without explicit namespace qualifiers.
