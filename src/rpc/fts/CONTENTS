This directory contains code used only in stochastic FTS calculations
using a partial saddle-point approximation on CPU hardware.

Subdirectories:

simulator /   - Simulator base class and factory, class SimState
compressor/   - algorithms to iteratively find a partial saddle point
brownian/     - Brownian dynamics simulation 
montecarlo/   - Monte Carlo simulation
analyzer/     - data analysis classes (for on-the-fly or postprocessing)
trajectory/   - reading field trajectory files (postprocessing)
perturbation/ - perturbations of the Hamiltonian (e.g., Einstein crystal)
ramp/         - continuous change of parameters during a simulation

Makefile and makefile fragments:

makefile      - main makefile for rpc/fts directory tree
sources.mk    - list of source files (makefile fragment)

Doxygen documentation files:
