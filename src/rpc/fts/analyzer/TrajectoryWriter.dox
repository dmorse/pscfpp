\page rpc_TrajectoryWriter_page TrajectoryWriter

This analyzer periodically writes the w-field configuration to
frames of a trajectory file.  The resulting file can be read and 
postprocessed using the ANALYZE command of pscf_pc or pscf_pg.

\see TrajectoryWriter (class API)

\section rpc_TrajectoryWriter_parameter_sec Parameter File

The parameter file format for the associated block is shown below:
\code
TrajectoryWriter{
  interval           int
  outputFileName     string
}
\endcode
Both parameters are required. The interval must be positive
Meanings of the parameters are described briefly below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> <b> Label </b>  </td>
    <td> <b> Description </b>  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> interval </td>
    <td> number of steps between data samples </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
     <td> outputFileName </td>
     <td> name of output file </td>
  </tr>
</table>

\section rpc_TrajectoryWriter_output_sec Output

During the simulation, the w-field configuration is output to file 
{outputFileName} every interval simulation steps.

The resulting file contains a header section followed by a sequence
of frames. The format of the header is the same as that used for an
r-grid field file, and each frame uses the same format as that used
for the data section of an r-grid field file.
