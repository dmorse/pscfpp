\page rpc_McSimulator_page McSimulator

An instance of a class McSimulator<D> in namespace Pscf::Rpc (for pscf_pc)
or Pscf::Rpg (for pscf_pg) provides a variety of data structures and 
algorithms that are needed to implement a partial saddle-point field 
theoretic simulation (PS-FTS) using Monte-Carlo sampling, but that are not 
needed for self-consistent field (SCFT) calculation. The associated parameter 
file block is one of two possible option (McSimulator or BdSimulator) for 
the optional, selectable "Simulator" subblock of the main System block of 
the parameter file. 

\section rpc_McSimulator_parameter_sec Parameter File

The format of this parameter file block is given below in skeleton form:
\code
McSimulator{
  seed* int
  McMoveManager*{ ... }
  Compressor#*{ ... }
  Perturbation#*{ ... }
  Ramp#*{ ... }
  AnalyzerManager*{ ... }
}
\endcode
Here, as elsewhere in this manual, the suffixes # and * after a parameter
file sub-block name denote selectable and optional elements, respectively. 
The only difference between the format of an McSimulator block and that
of a \ref rpc_BdSimulator_page "BdSimulator" block is the presence of an 
McMoveManager sub-block for an McSimulator where a BdStep sub-block would 
appear for a BdSimulator.

Each allowed element of a McSimulator block is described in more detail 
below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> seed* </td>
    <td> Optional random seed, which must be a positive integer. If no 
    seed is set, the random number generator will be initialized using 
    a seed generated from the system clock. (optional) 
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> McMoveManager* </td>
    <td>
    The McMoveManager block contains a set of one or more McMove objects
    that describe Monte Carlo moves that will be used during an MC PS-FTS
    simulation. (optional)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Compressor#* </td>
    <td>
    A Compressor is an iterative solver that adjusts the Lagrange
    multiplier chemical potential field in order to satisfy the 
    incompressibility constraint, thus finding a partial-saddle point 
    field condition. (selectable and optional, with conditions)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Perturbation#* </td>
    <td>
    An optional Perturbation block defines a perturbation or modification
    of the field theoretic Hamiltonian, as for, e.g., the Einstein crystal
    thermodynamic integration method.  (selectable and optional)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Ramp#* </td>
    <td>
    An optional Ramp block prescribes a continuous change in one or more
    system parameters during the course of a simulation, as used during
    continuous thermodynamic integration. Though this is coded as an
    optional selectable block, the only option that is currently 
    implemented is a LinearRamp which prescribes a change in one or more 
    parameters that change linearly with time (i.e., with the simulation 
    step counter).  (selectable and optional, with conditions)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> AnalyzerManager* </td>
    <td>
    The optional AnalyzerManager block contains subblocks that 
    initialize one or Analyzer objects, each of which implements a 
    data analysis and/or data output operation that will be carried 
    out periodically during a simulation (on-the-fly) or during 
    analysis of a field trajectory file (postprocessing). (optional).
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
The McMoveManager and Compressor must bost be present in order to actually 
perfom and MC simulation (command SIMULATE), but are optional because 
neither is needed in a parameter file that is used for postprocessing of 
a field trajectory (command ANALYZE).

Required relationships among subblocks:

  - If an McMoveManager block is present and contains one or more MC 
    moves, then a Compressor block is required. Rationale: MC move
    algorithms rely on the existence of an associated Compressor.

  - The Ramp block may only be present if a McMoveManager block is 
    present and contains one or more MC moves. Rationale: A Ramp 
    is only used during a simulation, and not during postprocessing
    of a trajectory file.
