The RealMove classes used by both the pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs 
implements a simple MC move for which the attempted move is a random
change at every grid point.

Two closely analogous classes named Pscf::Rpc::RealMove and 
Pscf::Rpg::RealMove that are defined in different namespaces are used 
to implement this the same step algorithm for different programs. 
The RealMove class defined in the Rpc namespace is used in the pscf_pc 
program (using CPU hardware) and the class defined in the Rpg namespace 
is used in the pscf_pg program (using GPU acceleration). These two 
classes implement the same step algorithm and use the same parameter 
file format, which are documented below.

\section rpc_RealMove_algorithm_sec Step Algorithm

A general discussion of MC move algorithms for PS-FTS is given on a 
\ref psfts_algorithm_MC_sec "separate page". As discussed there, each 
attempted MC move consists of an unconstrained change in the fields, 
followed by application of a compressor to re-impose the 
incompressibility constraint. The decision about whether to accept 
or reject the move is based on the value of the Hamiltonian after 
incompressibility has been restored by adjusting the pressure-like
field.

The RealMove algorithm takes one parameter, denoted by sigma. The
unconstrained move each monomer field component at each grid point
by a random amount chosen from the Gaussian distribution with zero 
mean and a standard deviation of a sigma. 

\section rpc_RealMove_parameter_sec Parameter File

The only parameter needed by this algorithm are the "probability" 
parameter, which determines the probability that a move of this type 
will be chosen on any step, and a required parameter named sigma, as 
described above.  A typical example of the contents of this is 
shown below.
\code
  RealMove{
    probability  0.05
    sigma     0.005
  }
\endcode
The parameter file format is thus:
\code
RealMove{
  probability  float (in range [0,1])
  sigma        float
}
\endcode
Meanings of both parameters are described briefly below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> <b> Label </b>  </td>
    <td> <b> Description </b>  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> probability </td>
    <td> probability of attempting a step of this type  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> sigma </td>
    <td> the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution from which 
         the step size is chosen </td>
  </tr>
