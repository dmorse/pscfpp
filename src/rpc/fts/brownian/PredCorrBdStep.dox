The PredCorrBdStep classes used by both the pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs 
implements a predictor corrector Brownian dynamics step algorithm.

Two closely analogous classes named Pscf::Rpc::PredCorrBdStep and 
Pscf::Rpg::PredCorrBdStep are used to implement this algorithm for the 
pscf_pc program (using a standard CPU) and for the pscf_pg program
(using GPU acceleration), respectively  These classes implement the 
same algorithm and use the same parameter file format, as documented 
below.

\section rpc_PredCorrBdStep_algorithm_sec Step Algorithm

A general discussion of conventions used in PSCF for BD step algorithms 
is given \ref psfts_algorithm_page "here".  In what follows, we refer
to the fields or fields that are stochastically sampled as \f$ W_{-} \f$,
or as exchange fields, and the field or fields that are chosen to satisfy 
a partial saddle point condition as \f$ W_{+} \f$.  All exchange fields
must be associated with negative eigenvalues of the projecte chi matrix.
Each step of the predictor corrector algorithm involves the following
stages:
<ul>
<li> Generate and save random displacements of \f$ W_{-} \f$ at each
grid point. These random displacements will be used for both the 
predictor and corrector steps. </li>
<li> Use an explicit Euler step algorithm to generate small changes in 
\f$ W_{-} \f$, using forces (i.e., functional derivatives of the
Hamiltonian) that were computed in the initial state. This is the
"predictor" step. 
<li> Use the compressor algorithm chosen by the user to adjust 
\f$ W_{+} \f$ so as to satisfy the partial saddle-point condition 
at the predicted state. </li>
<li> Compute forces in the predicted state (i.e., i,e., compute 
functional derivatives of the Hamiltonian with respect to components
of \f$ W_{-} \f$). </li>
<li> Apply an explict BD step to the initial configuration with 
forces that are the average of those computed at the initial state
and thosed computed in the predicted state, using the same random 
field displacements as those used in the predictor step.  This is the 
"corrector" step.
<li> Use the compressor to adjust \f$ W_{+} \f$ so as to again satisfy
the partial saddle-point condition in the final state.
</ul>

\section rpc_PredCorrBdStep_parameter_sec Parameter File

The only parameter need by this algorithm is a required parameter named 
"mobility", which gives the value of parameter denoted by \f$ \gamma \f$ 
in the our description of an explicit Euler algorithm.  
A typical example of the contents of the block is shown below:
\code
  PredCorrBdStep{
    mobility     1e-3
  }
\endcode
The format of this block is simply
\code
PredCorrBdStep{
   mobility      float
}
\endcode
The mobility parameter is requred.
