This directory contains three simple usage examples for the unit test 
framework:

example1 constructs and runs a UnitTestRunner. 
example2 constructs and runs a CompositeTestRunner for two unit tests.

example3 is compiled only if UTIL_MPI is defined, and demonstrates
use of a UnitTestRunner for an MPI job.
