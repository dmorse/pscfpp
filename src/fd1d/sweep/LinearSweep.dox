\page fd1d_LinearSweep_page Fd1d::LinearSweep

A Pscf::Fd1d::LinearSweep<D> object allows the user to optionally perform
a linear parameter sweep, in which one or more parameters in the system (e.g.
chi, phi, segment length values) are linearly varied and a solution is found
at each linear step along the sweep.

The parameter file format for a LinearSweep object is:
\code
LinearSweep{
  ns                int
  baseFileName*     string
  historyCapacity*  int (3 by default)
  nParameter        int
  parameters        Array[ SweepParameter ]
}
\endcode
Here, as elsewhere, labels followed by an asterisk (*) represent optional 
elements.

Parameters and subblocks are described below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> ns </td>
    <td> Number of steps to be taken along the linear sweep. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> baseFileName* </td>
    <td> String to prepend to the filenames of all output files written
         during this sweep. E.g., if set to "out/", all files will be 
         written to the out/ subdirectory. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> historyCapacity* </td>
    <td> Number of previous states along the sweep that are to be stored
         and used to generate the initial guess for the next step along
         the sweep (via extrapolation). </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> nParameters </td>
    <td> Number of parameters to vary in the sweep. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> parameters </td>
    <td> Array of SweepParameters, specifying the parameter to be swept
         and the amount by which to change the parameter. See the detailed
         description on the SweepParameter page for a summary of how to write
         each different type of sweep parameter. Options are kuhn, chi, 
         block, solvent, phi_polymer, mu_polymer, phi_solvent, and mu_solvent.
