Todo for 1D finite difference code:

1) Write code to calculate total Helmholtz free energy and pressure.

2) Test propagator, spatialAverage, and iterator for cylindrical mode.

3) Add system default ensemble and species ensemble to readParameters

4) Test grand-canonical ensemble (canonical vs. grand).
