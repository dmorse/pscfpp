This src/ directory contains all C++ and CUDA source code for the PSCF 
package.  The subdirectories util/, pscf/, prdc/, r1d/, rpc/, and rpg/ 
each contain source code for classes and functions defined in a particular 
C++ namespace.  Subdirectories util/ and test/ are maintained as separate 
github repositories that are installed as submodules of the pscfpp 
respository. 

Subdirectories (corresponding namespace names in parentheses):

  util/  general utilities for scientific computation (Util)
  pscf/  shared classes accessible to the entire PSCF package (Pscf)
  prdc/  shared classes for periodic structures (Pscf::Prdc)
  r1d/   real fields, one-dimensional SCFT (Pscf::R1d)
  rpc/   real periodic fields, SCFT & PS-FTS on CPU (Pscf::Rpc)
  rpg/   real periodic fields, SCFT & PS-FTS on GPU (Pscf::Rpg)
  test/  unit testing framework (base classes)

  Directories r1d, rpc, and rpg each contain code that is only used by
  and accessible to a single executable program, namely pscf_1d, pscf_pc 
  or pscf_pg, respectively. Directories util, pscf, and prdc each contain
  code that is used by two or more programs.
