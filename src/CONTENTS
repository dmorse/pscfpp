This src/ directory contains all C++ and CUDA C++ source code for the PSCF 
package.  The subdirectories util/, pscf/, prdc/, r1d/, rpc/, and rpg/ 
each contain source code for classes and functions defined in a particular 
C++ namespace.  Subdirectories util/ and test/ are maintained as separate 
github repositories that are installed as submodules of the pscfpp 
respository. 

Subdirectories (with corresponding C++ namespace names in parentheses):

  util/  general utilities for scientific computation (Util)
  pscf/  shared classes accessible throughout the PSCF package (Pscf)
  prdc/  shared classes for periodic structures (Pscf::Prdc)
  r1d/   real fields, one-dimensional SCFT (Pscf::R1d)
  rpc/   real periodic fields, SCFT & PS-FTS on CPU (Pscf::Rpc)
  rpg/   real periodic fields, SCFT & PS-FTS on GPU (Pscf::Rpg)
  test/  unit testing framework (base classes)

  Directories r1d, rpc, and rpg are "program level" directories that each 
  contain code that is only accessible to and used by a single executable 
  program, namely, pscf_1d, pscf_pc or pscf_pg.

  Directories util, pscf, and prdc each contain code that may be used in
  two or more programs. Names defined by files in the util/ and pscf/ 
  directories are accessible anywhere in PSCF, while names defined in
  the prdc/ directory are only used in prdc/, rpc/ and prg/ directories.

  makefile - main makefile for in-source compilation (build in src/)
  programs.mod - doxygen page for program command-line interfaces
  CONTENTS - this file

Files (initially installed by the configure script):
