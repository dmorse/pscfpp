package.  Each of the subdirectories util/, pscf/, fd1d/, pspc/, and pspg/ 
contain source code from a particular C++ namespace.  Subdirectories util/ 
and test/ are maintained as separate github repositories that are installed 
as submodules of the pscfpp respository. All CUDA code is contained with
the pspg/ directory.
