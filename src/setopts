# Name: setopts
#
# Purpose: Sets makefile macros that control compile-time options
#
# This script should be called prior to compiling in order to enable or
# disable particular compile time features, or to modify some settings. 
# See the usage examples at the bottom of this documentation block. This 
# version of the script must be called from the root of the build directory 
# tree in the code will be compiled (e.g., the src/ directory for in-source
# compilation or the bld/ directory for out-of-source compilation.  Each 
# build directory contains a copy of this script.  Invoking the setopts 
# script in a specific build directory only affects code that is built in 
# that directory.
#
# The setopts script works by editing the config.mk makefile fragments 
# in the build directory from which it is called. These files control
# which preprocessor macros are passed to the compiler for code compiled 
# in that build directory.
#
# Synopsis:
#
#      ./setopts [options]
#
# Command Line Options: 
#   
# The -q and -h command line options both provide information, and take
# no argument:
#
#   -q     query: prints report of options that are enabled / disabled.
#   -h     help: prints a list of available options 
#
# The -d and -c options each enable or disable a feature. Each such
# option takes 0 or 1 as a required argument, using 1 to denote "enable"
# and 0 to denote "disable".
#
#   -d (0|1)   debugging           (defines/undefines UTIL_DEBUG)
#   -c (0|1)   CUDA code           (defines/undefines PSCF_CUDA) 
#
# The -a option sets an identifier for the NVIDIA GPU architecture to be 
# targeted by the nvcc NVIDIA CUDA compiler. The argument of this command 
# line option is passed as the argument of the "-arch" option of the nvcc
# C++ / CUDA compiler. Allowed values are string of the form sm_NN, where 
# NN is a number that gives the major and minor version number for the CUDA 
# "compute capability" for the target GPU. For example, the V100 GPU has 
# a compute capability 7.0, and requires an architecture code sm_70. 
#
#  -a [architecture code]          (defines NVARCH)
#
# See the NVIDIA web page https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus#compute 
# for a list of compute capabibilities for different GPU chips. 
#
# Examples:
#
# To enable debugging 
#
#   >  ./setopts -d1
#
# To disable debugging 
#
#   >  ./setopts -d0
#
# To enable compilation of CUDA code (which is disabled by default) and
# set the GPU architecture option to sm_70 (compute capability 7.0,
# appropriate for a V100 chip) one could enter
#
#   >  ./setopts -c1  -a sm_70
