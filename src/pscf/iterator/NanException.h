   * Exception thrown when not-a-number (NaN) is encountered.
   * 
   * An exception to be thrown when a required numerical parameter has a 
   * value of NaN. This may happen, for instance, as a result of dividing
   * by zero. A NanException is used rather than a generic Exception in 
   * these instances so that the NanException can be caught by a try-catch
   * block.
   * 
   * A NanException behaves identically to a generic Exception, but with a
   * pre-defined error message rather than a user-specified message. There 
   * is no preprocessor macro to throw a NanException, so they must be thrown
   * using the constructor. This will typically assume the following syntax,
   * where values of the file and line parameters are given by the built-in 
   * macros __FILE__ and __LINE__, respectively:
   * \code
   *    throw Exception("MyClass::myFunction", __FILE__, __LINE__ );
   * \endcode
