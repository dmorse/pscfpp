The src/pscf directory contains source files for classes or functions that
are defined in top level Pscf C++ namespace and that can be used by any 
program in the PSCF package.  

Subdirectories:
---------------

   chem/        - molecular structure descriptors
   cuda/        - utilities for graphics processing units (GPUs)
   homogeneous/ - spatially homogeneous mixtures
   inter/       - interaction (excess) free energy 
   iterator/    - utilities for iterator algorithms
   math/        - mathematical utilities
   mesh/        - spatial mesh and mesh iterators
   solvers/     - templates for modified diffusion eqn (MDE) solvers 
   sweep/       - utilities for SCFT sweep algorithms
   tests/       - unit tests for code in src/pscf

All classes in subdirectory pscf/homogeneous are defined in a nested 
namespace Pscf::Homogeneous 

C++ file:
---------

paths.h  - directory paths used by C++ files (installed by configure script)

Makefile and makefile fragments:
--------------------------------

makefile     - main makefile for src/pscf directory tree
sources.mk   - list of source files in src/pscf (makefile fragment)
patterns.mk  - pattern rules for use in src/pscf (makefile fragment)
include.mk   - header of makefile file includes (makefile fragment)

Doxygen documentation file:
---------------------------

pscf.mod     - definition of Pscf_NS_Module doxygen topics module
