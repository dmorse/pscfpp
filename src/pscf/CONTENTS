The src/pscf directory contains source files in namespace Pscf that can be 
used in several different implementations of self-consistent field theory. 
All code defined in this directory is defined in the Pscf C++ namespace.

Subdirectories:

   chem/        - molecular structure descriptors
   homogeneous/ - spatially homogeneous mixtures
   inter/       - models of interaction (excess) free energy 
   iterator/    - templates for iterator algorithms
   math/        - mathematical utilities
   mesh/        - spatial mesh
   solvers/     - templates for modified diffusion eqn (MDE) solvers 
   sweep/       - template for sweep algorithms
   tests/       - unit tests for code in src/pscf

All classes in subdirectory homogeneous are defined in a nested namespace 
Pscf::Homogeneous
