   /**
   * Descriptor for a linear or acyclic branched block polymer.
   *
   * A PolymerSpecies has an array of Vertex objects and an associated
   * array of Edge objects. Together, these provide a description of the
   * connectivity graph, block lengths and block monomer types of blocks 
   * within a block polymer.  A PolymerSpecies object does not provide
   * function required to solve the modified diffusion equation (MDE), 
   * and so is a descriptor but not a solver for a polymer species. 
   *
   * PolymerSpecies is an abstract base class for classes that act as
   * MDE solvers as well as descriptors.  Each implementation level 
   * sub-namespace of Pscf (i.e., R1d, Rpc or Rpg) contains a subclass 
   * of PolymerSpecies named Polymer that defines a function named 
   * compute() that solves the MDE for all blocks of a block polymer.  
   * Each such implementation level sub-namespace also contains a 
   * subclass of Edge named Block that is an MDE solver and descriptor 
   * for a single block within a block polymer.
   *
   * The Polymer class in each implementation-level namespace is derived 
   * directly from an template instantiation Pscf::PolymerTmpl<Block> of 
   * the class template Pscf::PolymerTmpl, while PolymerTmpl<Block> is 
   * derived directly from PolymerSpecies. A PolymerTmpl<Block> has a 
   * private member variable that is an array of Block solver objects. 
   * The PolymerTmpl template defines implementations of edge(int id) 
   * functions that are declared as pure virtual functions of 
   * PolymerSpecies, each of which which returns a specific Block solver 
   * object as a reference to an Edge.
   *
   * The PolymerSpecies class provides a generic description of polymer
   * structure that only uses names of generic descriptor types (such as
   * as Edge and Vertex) that are defined directly in the Pscf namespace.
   * The PolymerSpecies interface does not use any of the specialized 
   * solver classes that are defined in each implementation level 
   * sub-namespaces of Pscf, such as the different Block and Polymer 
   * classes defined in different sub-namespaces for use in different 
   * implementations. A reference to such a specialized Polymer solver
   * object as a generic PolymerSpecies can thus be used as an argument
   * to a generic function that requires a description of the polymer
   * molecular structure, but that does not actually solve the MDE.
