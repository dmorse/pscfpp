   /**
   * Abstract descriptor for a mixture of polymer and solvent species.
   *
   * A MixtureBase has an array of Monomer objects and provides access to
   * PolymerSpecies and SolventSpecies objects describing all molecular
   * species in in a mixture.  The MixtureBase class does not have 
   * functions or data structures needed to solve the modified diffusion 
   * equation (MDE), and is thus a descriptor but not a solver for the 
   * mixture. 
   *
   * MixtureBase is an abstract base class for "solver" classes that can 
   * actually solve the single-molecule statistical mechanics problem for 
   * very species in a mixture. Each implementation level sub-namespace 
   * of Pscf (R1d, Rpc or Rpg) contains a concrete class named Mixture 
   * that is derived from Pscf::MixtureBase, and that acts as both a 
   * solver and descriptor for the mixture.  Each such subspace also 
   * defines an polymer MDE solver class named Polymer that is a subclass 
   * of PolymerSpecies and a solvent solver class named Solvent that is 
   * subclass of SolventSpecies.  
   * 
   * The Mixture class in each such implementation-level namespace is a 
   * subclass of an instantiation Pscf::PolymerTmpl<Polymer, Solvent> of 
   * the class template Pscf::PolymerTmpl. This template is derived 
   * directly from MixtureBase. A PolymerTmpl<Polymer, Solvent> object has 
   * two member private variables that are arrays of Polymer and Solvent 
   * solver objects.  The PolymerTmpl template defines implementations of 
   * functions polymerSpecies(int id) and solventSpecies(int id) that are
   * declared as pure virtual member functions of MixtureBase. These
   * functions return a single Polymer solver object as a reference to
   * a PolymerSpecies descriptor, or a Solvent solver object as a 
   * reference to a SolventSpecies descriptor, respectively.
