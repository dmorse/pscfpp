      * is often contained within the FieldGenerator objects. Therefore,
      * this method allows subclasses of FieldGenerator to modify the 
      * stress.
      * 
      * The method is called by the MixAndMatchEnv object that owns this
      * object, and the return value should be used to optimize the 
      * lattice parameters. 
      * 
      * By default, this method will simply return the value of stress
      * that is provided as an input, without performing a modification,
      * which corresponds to a stress that will be used to minimize 
      * fHelmholtz.
