   * Template for classes that internally generate masks and external fields.
   * 
   * An "environment" in PSCF is defined to be a set of user-defined, 
   * externally imposed fields that affect the resulting SCFT solution.
   * This includes masks and external potential fields. Masks define an
   * inhomogeneous density constraint, where certain regions of the 
   * calculation box may have reduced or zero polymer density. External
   * potential fields define inhomogeneous energetic penalties for 
   * monomer species to be located at certain positions, which are 
   * separate from the saddle-point 'w' potential fields generated by
   * the surrounding species. 
   * 
   * Environment classes (subclasses of Environment) are created
   * through the inclusion of an optional, polymorphic Environment 
   * block of the parameter file. Different combinations of masks and
   * external fields (i.e., different types of environments) will have
   * different class names and different required parameters to define
   * the imposed fields. If an Environment block is included in a 
   * parameter file, the Environment class will read the necessary 
   * parameters, construct imposed fields, and update them as needed.
   * 
   * Imposed fields, in general, are dependent on the size of the 
   * calculation box. If the fields deform non-affinely upon changing
   * the box size, then the imposed fields will also contribute to the
   * stress. Therefore, Environment classes have a stress() method that
   * returns the Environment's contribution to the stress. 
   * 
   * Furthermore, it may be preferable with certain imposed fields to 
   * minimize a property other than fHelmholtz with respect to the 
   * lattice parameters. For instance, in a thin film it is useful to 
   * minimize the excess free energy per unit area, 
   *     (fHelmholtz - fRef) * Delta, 
   * where fRef is a reference free energy and Delta is the film 
   * thickness. To minimize alternative free-energetic properties,
   * one must use an alternate form of the stress. Environment classes
   * provide a method called modifyStress() to convert the stress into
   * this alternate form, which will vary depending on the type of
   * Environment.
