UnitCell<D>:

   Add a value Null to each LatticeType<D>::LatticeSystem

   Initialize the value of latticeSystem_ to Null in the constructor, to allow 
   checks that a LatticeSystem has been set as precondition for other functions.

   Create a private function, setBasis that only sets rBasis, kBasis, drBasis.

   Change setLattice() so as to call (in this order)
      initializeToZero, setBasis(), computeDerivatives()

   (This is in preparation for moving setLattice to UnitCellBase).

UnitCellBase:

   Private implementation changes:

      Declare a pure virtual function set setBasis();

      Migrate declaration of setLattice to UnitCellBase.

   Changes to public interface (may require changes elsewhere):

     Change function SetParams() to setParameters(Farray<double, 6>) to 
     take an array of parameters.  Make this function call setLattice().

     Note/Rationale: You want to make it very difficult for a user to 
     create inconsistent data. You can do this by forcing them to input
     all parameters at once and then update all data structures within
     the function that updates the parameters.
   
     Note: In this code base, functions and variable names are "lower
     case camel", i.e., lower case first letter, words after the first
     begin upper case, e.g., setParameters() rather than setParams().

     Change params() to parameters() and have it return an FArray<double, 6>
  
     Change const int nParams() to int nParameter()

     Note: Names of functions that return values should generally be the
     same as names of corresponding private member variables, e.g., member
     variable parameters_ is returned by function parameters(). Functions
     that return one element of a container should use singular form of
     the container name. Container names are generally plural.

     Note: Convention elsewhere in this C++ code is that parameters that 
     tell the number of things have names of the form nThing (not nThings).
     Hence, the function name should be nParameter().  You could argue for 
     use of plural, but the choice is arbitrary, and consistency matters 
     more to people that try to extend code than which convention you choose. 

     Find and change all invokations of params() and nParams() elsewhere.

     Add function double parameter(int i) that returns one parameter.
     Rationale: convenience. Sometimes you only need one parameter.
  
     Remove const qualifier from return value of double, int functions.

     Note: A const qualifier on a return value is only needed on references 
     and pointers. It is superfluous when applied to a primitive type that
     is returned by value. For simple accessor functions, the function 
     should be marked const, rather than the return value.

     Tests:

         Add more explicit tests of elements of drrBasis and dggBasis 
         for specific lattice systems. Eventually need to implement test, 
         hexagonal, oblique, etc.

shiftToMinimum:

   The algorithm is designed to work only with non-negative components.
   This is a bug waiting to happen.  Modify so it works with negative 
   components.
