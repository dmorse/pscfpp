To get a minimally functional Basis class template:

1) Remove separate (public!) array containing dkSq (it is now a 
member Basis::Star::dEigen of class Basis::Star).

2) Add code to compute dEigen member of each Star to makeStars() function.

3) Add code to compute "implicit" member for each Basis::Wave.

4) Add code to allow wavevectors to be identitified by dft indices,
   without assumptions about ordering: 

     - Add an array indexOfWave_ that contains indices of waves within
       the wavew array, indexed by the rank of indicesDft wave within
       the mesh. 

     - Add function "indexOfWave(IntVec<D> ) that computes the rank of
       a wave that is within the DFT mesh, looks up the corresponding
       index within the indexOfWave_ array, and returns the index value.

5) Adapt conversion functions (basis-to-DFT and DFT-to-basis) as needed 
to work with updated data structures. Test these functions.

6) Add function Basis::update(const UnitCell& unitCell) that updates
the values of eigen and dEigen for all stars. You will need to call
this each time the unit cell parameters change.

7) Add code to generate star for an arbitrary space group

8) Add code to identify cancelled stars (not necessary for identity group).

9) Add code to read a space group from a file, given space group name.
