\page pscf_1d_page pscf_1d  - One-dimensional SCFT (CPU)

Program for one-dimensional (1D) SCFT problems. The implementation
uses a regular grid and finite-difference algorithm for solving the 
modified diffusion equation. This program can treat one-dimensional
problems in which all fields depend on a single Cartesian coordinate, 
or treat problems with spherical or cylindrical symmetry in which
fields depend on a single radial coordinate.  It is thus useful for 
treating flat interfaces, curved spherical or cylindrical interfaces, 
and spherical or cylindrical micelles. 

\section pscf_1d_usage_section Usage

    pscf_1d  -p file -c file [-i prefix] [-o prefix] [-e]

\section pscf_1d_options_section Command Line Options

  -p file

   Set the parameter file name, given by the argument "file".
   The -p and -r options are incompatible: A simulation must be
   initialized with either a parameter file or a restart file, 
   but not both. 

  -c file

   Set the command file name, given by the argument "file". 

  -i prefix

   Set the input file path prefix, given by the argument "prefix".

  -o prefix

   Set the output file path prefix, given by the argument "prefix".

  -e

   Enable echoing of parameter file to log file as it is read. This
   option is often useful for debugging the parameter file.
