An R1d::AmIterator<D> object is an iterator that solves the 1D SCFT 
equations using a \ref pscf_AmIteratorTmpl_page "Anderson-Mixing" 
algorithm.

\section r1d_AmIterator_param_sec Parameter File 

An example of the parameter file format for this iterator is shown below:
\code
  AmIterator{
    epsilon       1e-8
    maxItr        100
    maxHist       50
    verbose       int (0-2, 0 by default)
    errorType     relNorm
  }
\endcode
The format of this block is described more formally below:
\code
 AmIterator{
   epsilon       real 
   maxItr*       int (200 by default)
   maxHist*      int (50 by default)
   verbose*      int (0-2, 0 by default)
   outputTime*   bool (false by default)
   errorType*    string ("norm", "rms", "max", or "relNorm".
                    "relNorm" by default)
  
}
\endcode
Here, as elsewhere, labels followed by an asterisk (*) represent 
optional parameters. The meaning of various parameters are described 
below, and also as part of a more general discussion of 
\ref pscf_AmIteratorTmpl_page "Anderson-Mixing" algorithms:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> <b> Label </b>  </td>
    <td> <b> Description </b>  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> epsilon </td>
    <td> Desired tolerance for convergence - iteration stops if the 
         magnitude of the error drops below epsilon (Required) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> maxItr* </td>
    <td> Maximum number of iterations that will be attempted
         (Optional, 200 by default) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> maxHist* </td>
    <td> Maximum number of previous trial solultions that will be 
         retained in memory for use by the AM algorithm 
         (Optional, 50 by default) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> verbose* </td>
    <td> Integer with allowed values 0-2 for the level of 
         verbosity of output to log file during iteration.  
         (Optional, 0 by default).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> showTime* </td>
    <td> Optional boolean (0 or 1). Set true (1) to output a report of 
         components of wall clock time during iteration, or false (0) 
         to skip.  Optional, and false by default. 
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> errorType* </td>
    <td> Identifer for the type of scalar error compared to epsilon to
         test convergence.  Allowed values are "norm", "rms", "max" and 
         "relNorm", as discussed \ref pscf_AmIteratorTmpl_page "here". 
         Optional, and equal to "relNorm" by default. </td>
  </tr>
</table>
The iterative loop exits if the number of iterations has reached maxItr 
or if the magnitude of the scalar error is less than epsilon. 

<b> errorType </b>: Several different definitions may be used for 
the scalar error, depending on the value of the identifier errorType. 

  - If errorType == norm, then the scalar error is take to be the L2 norm
    of the residual vector defined below (i.e., the sum of the squares of 
    all residual elements).

  - If errorType == rms, then the scalar error is the root mean squared
    magnitude per element. This is equal to the L2 norm divided by the 
    square root of the number of elements.

  - If errorType == max, then the scalar error is take to be the 
    maximum of the absolute magnitude of the elements of the residual 
    vector (the L infinity norm of the residual vector).

  - If errorType == norm, then the scalar error is take to be the ratio 
    of the L2 norm of the residual vector to the L2 norm of the w field, 
    as in Stasiak and Matsen, Eur. Phys, Journel E, 2012. 

\section r1d_AmIterator_residual_sec Residual Definition

The algorithm is designed to reduce the values of the elements of a 
vector of residuals (i.e., errors) until they are zero to within some
tolerance, as defined by one of the scalar norms discussed above.
The definition of the vector of residuals used in this algorithm is 
analogous to that given in Eq.  (10) of the article by  Arora et al. 
[Arora, Morse, Bates and Dorfman, J. Chem.  Phys. vol. 146 224902 (2017)].
The main difference is that here residual values are associated with 
values at grid points, rather than coefficients in the Fourier expansion
used in the algorithm described in that reference.  To describe the 
residuals expressions here, we use zero based indexing for monomer types, 
use \f$ N_{x} \f$ to denote the number of grid points (referred to in the 
parameter file and source code as nx), and use \f$ N_{m} \f$ to denote 
the number of monomer types (referred to elsewhere as nMonomer).

The vector of residuals for a pscf_1d calculation has \f$ N_{x}N_{m} \f$ 
(or nx * nMonomer) scalar residuals.  Let \f$ w_{ia} \f$ and 
\f$ \phi_{ai} \f$ denote the values of the chemical potential field 
\f$ w_{i} \f$ and volume fraction \f$ \phi_{i} \f$ for monomer type 
i at grid point \f$a\f$, respectively,  The corresponding residual 
component \f$ R_{ai}\f$ associated with grid point \f$ a \f$ and monomer 
type \f$ i \f$ is given, by analogy to Eq. (10) of Arora et al. (JCP 2017), 
as 
\f[
  R_{ai} = \sum_{j=0}^{N_{m}-1} 
           \left ( \chi_{ij} \phi_{aj} - P_{ij}w_{aj} \right ) 
  \quad.
\f]
where \f$ P_{ij} \f$ is an element of an idempotent 
\f$ N_{m} \times N_{m} \f$ matrix \f$  P \f$ that can be 
expressed in matrix notation as
\f[
  P  = I
  - \frac{\epsilon \epsilon^{T} \chi^{-1} }
        { \epsilon^{T} \chi^{-1} \epsilon }
 \quad.
\f]
Here, \f$ I \f$ is the identity matrix,
\f$ \chi^{-1} \f$ is the matrix inverse of the \f$\chi\f$ matrix, 
and \f$\epsilon\f$ is a \f$ N_{m} \f$-component column vector with 
elements given by \f$ \epsilon_{i} = 1 \f$ for all 
\f$ i = 0, \ldots, N_{m}-1 \f$.

\section r1d_AmIterator_closed_sec Closed Systems (Canonical Ensemble)

A slight modification of the residual definition is required in the case
when a value of phi rather than mu is specified for every molecular 
species, giving a closed system, or a canonical statistical ensemble. In 
this case, the solution of the SCF problem is not unique, becase the 
values of the residuals defined above can be shown to be invariant under 
a shift in all of the chemical potential fields at all grid point points 
by any spatially homgeneous constant.  To obtain a unique solution, the 
update procedure shifts the chemical potential fields so as to guarantee 
that the w field value for the last monomer type at the last grid point 
is forced to equal zero by convention.
