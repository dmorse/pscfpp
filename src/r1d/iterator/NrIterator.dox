\page r1d_NrIterator_page R1d::NrIterator

A Pscf::R1d::NrIterator<D> object is an iterator that solves the SCFT 
equations using the Newton-Raphson method.  The only user-defined 
parameters are the the error tolerance (epsilon) and the max number of 
iterations (maxItr).

The cost of the NR algorithm used here increases rapidly with the number 
of grid points, and becomes inefficient for problems with greater than 
roughly 1000 grid points. The algorithm converges in very few iterations 
from a good initial guess, but has a high computational cost per 
iteration, and is not particularly robust in the face of a poor initial 
guess.

\section r1d_NrIterator_param_sec Parameter File 

The parameter file format for an R1d::NrIterator object is:
\code
NrIterator{
   epsilon     real
   maxItr*     int (100 by default)
}
\endcode
Note that maxItr is an optional parameter, which is set to 100 by default. 
Parameters are described below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> epsilon </td>
    <td> Error tolerance. 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> maxItr* </td>
    <td> maximum number of iterations attempted (optional, 100 by default) 
         </td>
  </tr>
</table>
Iteration stops when every element of the residual vector (described below)
has an absolute magnitude less than epsilon.

\section r1d_NrIterator_residual_sec Residual Definition

This iterator defines nMonomer residual expressions at each grid point, 
and stops iteration when the resulting vector of residuals is zero to 
within some tolerance.  In what follows, to describe how the residuals 
are defined , we use zero based indices monomer types, and use the 
notation \f$ M \f$ to denote the number of monomer types, which is 
labelled nMonomer in the parameter file.  All but one of the residuals at 
each grid point are derived from the self-consistent field (SCF) equations, 
while the last residual at each grid point imposes incompressibility. 

The SCF equations at each grid point require that a quantity \f$ g_{i} \f$ 
vanish for each mononomer type \f$ i = 0, \ldots, M - 1\f$, where
\f[
    g_{i} \equiv
    \sum_{j=0}^{M-1} \chi_{ij}\phi_{j} + \xi - w_{i} 
\f]
where \f$ \phi_{i} \f$ and \f$ w_{i} \f$ are the volume fraction and 
chemical potential field for monomers of type i, \f$ \xi \f$ is a 
Langrange multiplier pressure field, and where all fields are evaluated 
at the same location (i.e., the same grid point).
The first \f$ M \f$ residuals at each grid point, which we denote by
\f$ r_{0}, \ldots, r_{M - 2} \f$, are given by differences 
\f[
  r_{i} = g_{i+1} - g_{0}
\f]
between values of \f$ g_{j} \f$ for monomer indices i+1 and 0.

The last residual at each grid point is given by the difference
\f[
  r_{M-1} = 
  \sum_{i=0}^{M-1}\phi_{i} - 1
\f]
between the sum of volume fractions and unity.

\section r1d_NrIterator_canonical_sec Closed Systems (Canonical Ensemble)

The residual equations must be modified slightly for the case in which 
a value of phi rather than mu is specified for every molecular species, 
giving a closed system or a canonical statistical mechanical ensemble.
In this case, it may be shown that the solution of the modified diffusion
equation yields concentration fields for which the spatial average of 
the sum of volume fractions of all species, averaged over the domain
volume, is always exactly equal to 1, for any choice of w fields. This 
means that, in this case, one of the incompressibility constraints is 
redundant, since the incompressibility constraint at the last grid point
would automatically satisfied if the constraints at the other points 
were all satisfied. In addition, in this case, the solution of the SCF 
equations is also not unique, because the residual values can be shown 
to be invariant under a shift in the Lagrange multiplier field at all 
grid point points by any spatially homgeneous constant. To address both 
problems, in the case of a closed system, the incompressibility 
constraint at the last grid point is replaced by a requirement that the 
w field value for the last monomer type must equal zero at this grid 
point, by convention.
