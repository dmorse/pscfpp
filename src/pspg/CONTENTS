This directory contains C++ and CUDA code specific to a GPU-accelerated
pseudo-spectral implementation of SCFT for periodic structures.  All
code in this directory is defined in the namespace Pscf::Rpg. Class
designs and algorithms are closely analogous to those of the C++ version
of this code in the src/pspc directory.

Subdirectories:

field/     - classes to represent or manipulate fields, including FFTs
iterator/  - iterative SCF equation solvers
math/      - CUDA resources and kernels for mathematical operations
solvers/   - modified diffusion equation solvers
simulate/  - classes for FTMC simulation
sweep/     - classes to implement continuation of solutions ("sweep")
tests/     - unit cell tests for code

Source Files:

pscf_pg.cpp  - Main program for perodic structure on a GPU
System.h     - System<D> class template header (main object)

Makefile and makefile fragments:

sources.mk   - list of source files (makefile fragment)
patterns.mk  - pattern rules for src/pspc (makefile fragment)
include.mk   - header of makefile includes (makefile fragment)
makefile     - main makefile for src/pspc directory tree
config.mk    - configuration file (installed by configure script)
