TODO (pspg GPU code):

Short term clean up (assigned primarily to G.K., ideally before submission)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Enable treatment of 1D and 2D problems: BatchFFT seems to have explicit
   specializations only for 3D transforms. Add explicit specializations 
   for D=1 and D=2, or rewrite as a template if possible. Then add 2D and 
   3D executable names to variable PSCF_PG_EXE in makefile.

2) Enable use of nonorthogonal unit cells such as 2D hexagonal: Remove 
   dependence on local src/pspg/UnitCell classes and local shiftToMinimum, 
   which seem to allow only non-orthogonal unit cells.  This should have
   been made easier and more efficient by the introduction of WaveList, 
   since this allows ksq and dksq to be computed only once when the unit 
   cell is initialized or modified.  As a first try, do these
   infrequent computations on the CPU using the existing classes and
   see if there is a measurable speed difference.

3) Add a few examples (e.g., lam, hex, and bcc) to the examples/pspg directory.

4) Replace dependence on Pscf::Pspg::ChiInteraction by dependence on the
   shared class Pscf::ChiInteraction. These classes look similar or 
   identical, so this should be easy. I don't see the reason for the
   duplicated class definition.

5) Change inclusion of deprecated "device_functions.h" file to appropriate 
   public file to suppress warnings from Cuda compiler on mesabi.

6) Figure out how to remove getopt/ from the public repository while 
   retaining the ability for GK to link to a local copy on his laptop, 
   perhaps by keeping that directory in the copy on his laptop and privately 
   changing a few lines in source and source.mk files in his copy. 

Intermediate (possibly before publication) (assigned primarily to Anshul)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Restore ability to read symmetry adapted files (without necessarily
   imposing symmetry during iteration). This may be possible before
   submission or, if not, before resubmission after reviews.

2) Restore iteration with imposed symmetry and output in symmetry adapted 
   format (may or may not be possible before final publication)

3) Try to implement suppression of implicit instantiation and compilation 
   of explicit instances of templates in pspg (as done elsewhere), to allow 
   more code to be compiled separately. This uses the C+11 extern syntax 
   to suppress implicit instantiation, and is possible only if the cuda 
   compiler recognizes this syntax.

Longer term  (probably after publication)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Write unit tests or other self-contained, self-validating tests of the 
   GPU code and put them in the repository. 

2) Complete doxygen documenttion for all classes, functions and parameters 
   in src/pspg.

3) Move WaveList class to directory solvers. It's essentially a utility 
   that is used by the solvers, and doesn't need its own directory.

4) Add sweep functionality 

5) Add point solvents
