TODO (pspg GPU code):

Short term (clean up):
----------------------

1) Add explicit specializations of BatchFFT for D=1 and D=2, or rewrite as
   a template to enable compilation of 2D and 3D code. Then add 2D and 3D 
   executable names to variable PSCF_PG_EXE in makefile.

2) Change inclusion of "device_functions.h" to appropriate public file to
   suppress warnings from Cuda compiler.

3) Move WaveList class to directory solvers. It's essentially a utility that
   is used by the solvers, and doesn't need its own directory.

4) Figure out how to remove getopt/ from the public repository while retaining
   the ability for GK to link to a local copy on his laptop, perhaps by keeping
   that directory in the copy on his laptop and privately changing a few lines
   in source and source.mk files in his copy. 

Longer term:
------------

1) Restore ability to read symmetry adapted files.

2) Restore iteration with imposed symmetry and output in symmetry adapted format.

3) Add sweep functionality and point solvent
