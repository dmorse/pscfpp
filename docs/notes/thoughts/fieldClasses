The use of the word Field to describe classes has gotten
to be confusing and inconsistent.

The Pscf::Pspc::Field template is simply a DArray in which
allocation uses special functions provided by FFTW. This is
subclassed by RField and RFieldDft.

The Pscf::Pspg::DField template is an analog of a DArray in
which data is on the GPU/device. This is subclassed by
RDField and RDFieldDft, so the names are not analogous to
those used in Pscf::Pspc. 


Proposal:
=========

Step 1: Establish consistent names
----------------------------------

1) Make Pscf::Pspc::Field to Pscf::Pspc::DArrayFftw to make it clear 
that is is simply a DArray that uses FFTW allocation statements to 
obtain aligned data.

2) Change DArray to make allocate, deallocate and reallocate member 
functions virtual, with default implementations that use standard C++ 
new and delete, and make Pscf::Pspc::DArrayFftw a subclass of DArray 
with these functions overloaded.

3) Change Pscf::Pspg::Field to Pscf::Pspg::DArrayGpu to make it clear 
that this is an analog of DArray in which data is held on the Gpu 
device.

4) In Pspg namespace, Rename RDField to RField and RDFieldDft to 
RFieldDft, to re-establish the analogy to the Pspc namespace.


Step 2: Change treatment of CUDA in build system
------------------------------------------------

Change the build system so that compilation of Cuda files is controlled 
by a makefile macro. Among other benefits, this will also allow mixing 
of C++ and CUDA files in the same namespace level directory.

Step 3: Separate out files involving periodic structures
--------------------------------------------------------

Goal: Allow re-use of files that treat periodic structures in other codes, 
which may use a different hardware, different molecular model (e.g., 
discrete rather than continous), different physical assumptions (compressible 
and nonlocal vs. incompressible and local) or different algorithms.

Create a director src/prdc and namespace Pscf::Prdc to hold all files that 
are specific to periodic structures. This would have subdirectories:

   prdc/
     crystal/
     mesh/
     field/cpu/
     field/gpu/

Create subnamespaces Pscf::Prdc::Cpu and Pscf::Prdc::Gpu to hold analogous 
files that are specific to CPU and GPU. 

Change build system to compile the contents of this directory.

Change build system of pspc/ and pspg/ to treat prdc directory as a 
dependence.

Add using namespace statements to use Pscf::Prdc and Pscf::Prdc::Cpu 
or Pscf::Prdc::Gpu to most or all files in pspc/ and pspg/.
