Generalizing Interaction class:

Observation: Existing codes are based on a simple common model of
interactions for an incompressible systemw with a local excess free
energy described by a Flory-Huggins form.

Implementation of complex Langevin simulations (CL-FTS) and 
generalizations of PS-FTS require non-local interactions and
(for CL-FTS) compressibility.

Proposal: 

- Move the existing Pscf::Interaction class to Pscf::R1d::Interaction.

- Also copy the Pscf::Interaction class to Pscf::Prdc::Interaction, and
  start modifying to allow wavenumber depends of elements of chi matrix
  in PS-FTS.

- Modify WaveList to list value of the smearing function for each 
  wavevector

- Later, create namespaces Pscf::Rf for programs that use real fields 
  (pscf_pc and pscf_pg) for SCFT and PS-PFTS and Pscf::Cf for CL code 
  that uses complex fields. Templates that have been created for 
  System, Domain, WFields, CFields, FieldIo etc.  could be moved into 
  Pscf::Rf.

Interaction model for PS-FTS (still incompressible):

   Member variables:

     Matrix<double> chi_
     bool isLocal_ (default true)

     double qc_;

     double alpha_;

     int n_


   Public function:

     // Smearing function (non-locality)
     double f(double q);

   Comments (why not make the model compressible?): 

      - Introducing compressiblity and nonlocality into PS-FTS would be
        a significant complication, because current code is built around 
        the idea of a projected chi matrix. To do this correctly, we 
        would have to diagonalize U = chi + B e e^{T} instead. 

      - I don't think that allowing compressiblity in PS-FTS would give
        yield significant new physical insight. It would just complicate 
        interpretation of simulations in terms of effective parameters
        by making the effective chi parameter depend on yet another 
        microscopic parameter.

      - Introduction of compressiblity in SCFT would make more sense,
        but would require a rethinking of the residual vector currently
        used in Anderson-mixing algorithms. 

      - Conclusion: Keep PS-FTS and SCFT incompressible for now.
        Consider later introduction of compressiblity in SCFT, but
        probabably not in PS-FTS.

Interaction model for complex Langevin simulations:

   Member variables:

      Matrix<double> chi_

      bool isLocal_

      bool isCompressible_

      double modulus_

   Member variables:

     double f(double q) -> damping function

   Comments:

      Damping function is used only if isLocal_ == false.

      If isCompressible_ and !isLocal_, then damping function applies 
      to all elements of U, including those arising from the compression 
      modulus.
