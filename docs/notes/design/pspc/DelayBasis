Goals
------

1) Avoid forcing a user to enter unit cell parameter data in the parameter
file that is then overwritten, because that is confusing.

2) To accomplish goal 1, make it possible to delay construction of a basis 
until the first time a field file is read.

Comments on current design / history
------------------------------------

The current code is designed to allow allow a clean initialization phase
during the reading of a (mostly) fixed format parameter file. The ideas
was that all essential variables are set and all large blocks of memory 
for fields and propagators are allocated in this process, and that most 
heap memory is allocated only once. This was motivated by a combination 
of simplicity and safety. More flexible policies regarding when variables 
are defined and when allocation occurs require much more thorough checking 
of preconditions throughout the code in order to avoid mysterious errors.  
Delaying construction of a Basis is one step away from that original
design strategy.


Possible Policies / Conventions
-------------------------------

We could consider several possible policies / conventions:

A - We could maintain the requirement that a single space group and basis
be used throughout the lifetime of a system, but delay construction of that
basis. In this case, the basis could normally be constructed when the first 
field file is read, while the basis is unitialized, using the unit cell 
parameters that are provided in that file. All files read by the System 
are expected to describe a field with the same space group symmetry. This
assumption can be enforced with an Exception or warning when a field file
header with inconsistent data is read.

B - We could allow the basis can be constructed more than once if we 
encounter a new space group name in a field file, but regard the mesh
dimensions as permanent after they are entered in the parameter file. 
This is somewhat more complicated than A, but doesn't make a lot of 
sense in terms of usability - why allow construction of a basis for 
an entirely different crystal but not allow the user to adjust the mesh 
dimensions? If you consider two entirely different structures, you may 
want to adjust the mesh dimensions accordingly.

C - We could allow more complete mutability by allowing the user to 
reconstruct all aspects of the Domain, including the mesh, at any time
during a calculation.
     
Comments:

Option B seems like a conceptually incoherent compromise, and 
unattractive as a result. Policy C would move the program towards much 
more flexibility, but would consequently involve larger changes in 
the program design.  Policy A gets rid of the confusing redundant 
unit cell parameters, but leaves most aspects of the current design 
unchanged.  

Choice:  I propose that we implement policy A.

User Interface
--------------

Proposed changes (assuming policy A):

1) Require the user to enter both a crystal system (unit cell type) and 
space group name in the parameter file. These two parameters act as an 
explicit declaration of the type of crystal that the program will deal 
with throughout its lifetime.  Do NOT require or allow a UnitCell
parameter in the parameter file.

Rationale: If we don't require an explicit declaration, then the lattice 
system and space group types in the first field file that is read provide 
an implicit declaration that the user never sees unless they read the 
header of that field file. I think that requiring an explicit declaration 
will make the interface clearer and less error prone: Explicit is clearer 
than implicit.

Rationale: The LatticeSystem is part of the unit cell type, along with 
the space group. For clarity it makes more sense to ask the user to 
declare both than to declare only the space group.

Rationale: In policy A, the lattice system and space group are permanent
for the lifetime of the system. Immutable parameters should be input in 
the parameter file. Unit cell parameters of a system with a flexible unit 
are mutable unknown variables that are changed during iteration that are
provided in the field file as part of the solution, and so should usualy
be read from a field file. 

Note: The inclusion of the lattice string as a required parameter 
would break backwards compatibility, but now is the time to consider
such changes.

Proposed Domain parameter file format:

Domain{
   mesh          32   32    32
   lattice       orthorhombic
   groupName     F_d_d_d
}

2) Provide a SET_UNIT_CELL command which reads in and resets unit cell 
parameters. 

Rationale: The user may have several reasons to set or adjust the unit 
cell from the command file after reading in a field (rather than manually
editing the field file header) or to provide parameters before constructing 
a basis (see below). This command would provide an alternative to the 
use of an optional parameter.

3) Provide a MAKE_BASIS command that constructs a basis using that unit 
cell.  The MAKE_BASIS command is valid only if called after SET_UNIT_CELL
but before any field file is read, since the basis can only constructed 
once.

Rationale: The user may have some reason to want to control the ordering
of basis functions by explicitly controlling the unit cell parameters 
used to construct a basis, rather than using whatever parameters are in
the first field file to be read.

Note: Users who want to enter unit cell dimensions would do so with a
command rather than in the parameter file. Prohibiting the input of 
unit cell parameter in the parameter file would further break backwards
compatibility of param file formats, but that would already be broken 
by adding a required latticeSystem parameter.

Technical details (under the hood):

1) The crystal system name can be read directly into a 
UnitCell<D>::LatticeSystem enumeration in order to confirm its 
validity and store its meaning as an enumeration value.

2) The space group name could be used to immediately construct a
SpaceGroup<D> member of the Domain, in order to confirm the validity
of the space group name. The resulting space group could later be 
passed to Basis:makeBasis(...) when information about the unit cell
is provided the first time one reads in a field file, or when the
commands SET_UNIT_CELL and makeBasis are read. The Domain would 
thus have a SpaceGroup<D> member as well as a Basis<D>.

Expected Complications
-----------------------

1) The number of basis functions is not known until we construct a basis, 
and may change if we change the basis. Delaying the construction of the
basis thus requires us to delay allocating all arrays that hold field 
components in symmetry-adapted basis format.  

2) We may have to allow the FieldIo to construct a basis within the read 
functions of Pspc::FieldIo, since the existence of an appropriate basis 
is used in some of the read functions. To implement policy A, we would
allow a basis to be constructed if and only if the basis is not 
initialized.

Proposed Plan:
--------------

1) Modify WFieldContainer and CFieldContainer to allow allocation and 
de-allocation of basis and r-grid fields separately (new functions
allocateBasis, delllocateBasis, allocateRGrid, allocateRGrid, and 
setNmonomer). Continue to require that nMonomer is set once and never 
changed. (Done, no change in external behavior).

2) Create separate private functions in System to allocate grid and 
basis format, called allocateFieldsGrid() and allocateFieldsBasis().
Initially call both during parameter file processing, but make it 
easy to later delay allocation of basis format arrays. 
(Done, no change in external behavior).

3) Add code to Domain create a SpaceGroup<D> group_ member, and to 
read a file to create a group immediately after reading the group name.
Then change the code that creates a basis so as use the overloaded
Basis::makeBasis function that takes a group as a parameter rather 
than a group name string.
(Done, no change in external behavior).

4) Modify the FieldIo read functions to construct an unitialized basis
if the basis is not initialized when the header is read.  As part of this, 
make the FieldIo::basisPtr_ a non-const pointer to allow the basis to be 
modified, and allow storage of a const pointer to a SpaceGroup.
(Done, no change in external behavior).

5) Temporarily make the unit cell parameter of the Domain block optional.
I'm proposing that we later remove this parameter - see below.
(Backwards compatible at this point, but won't function correctly if 
unitCell is absent).

6) Have the functions of System that read files test the initialization
state of basis before reading a file, and then compare the initialization 
status of basis_ before and after reading a field in order to determine if 
the basis was just initialized. Immediately after it is initialized, call 
the function System::allocateFieldsBasis to allocate all arrays with 
dimensions that depend on nBasis. Initialization status can be tested 
using the nBasis value: nBasis == 0 means it is not initialized.
(At this point, optional delayed construction of a basis functions).

7) In Domain, add a member of the Domain to stored the declared 
lattice system type, as member variable lattice_ of type 
UnitCell<D>::LatticeSystem. Add code to Domain::readParameters to
read this, and remove code to read unitCell from the param file.
Change all of the unit tests.
(This finally breaks backwards compatibility).

Rationale: I propose to make lattice_ a separate member of Domain, in 
addition to the lattice_ member of the UnitCell<D>, because I can't 
see any other good way to treat it as a parameter file parameter using 
the existing system for reading and writing parameters. That system 
requires access to a non-const pointer to the address of a parameter 
variable.  The lattice_ is a private member of a unit cell. The UnitCell 
is currently treated as a data type that is read from file using an 
overloaded >> operator, not as a ParamComposite. We could provide 
access to the address of UnitCell<D>::lattice_ by making UnitCell a
nested ParamComposite, but the syntax would involve another nested
UnitCell{ .... } block, which seems ugly and unnecessarily complex.

Rationale: The groupName_ and lattice_ members of Domain would both 
document the values as declared in the parameter file. Both declared
values can be used to check values that appear in field files, to
require that the same values are used in all field files that are 
read by the program. After the UnitCell_ is initialized, we would
require that its lattice_ member always be equal to the Domain::lattice_ 
parameter.

8) In FieldIo, add a const pointer to a UnitCell::LatticeSystem<D> 
as a private member.  In FieldIo::associate, pass and store a pointer 
to the Domain::lattice_ in addition to the space group name. Add
code to check this against values declared in field files.

9) Change all of the examples to use the new param file format.
