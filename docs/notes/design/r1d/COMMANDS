In Fd1d::System, add commands / functions:

   readW(filename)
   writeW(filename);
   writeC(filename);
   iterate()  -> also calls outputThermo
   compute();
   sweep();
   compare(field, field)

Reconsider FieldIo functions.

   What to do about functions that require information about
   the Polymer or Mixture?
