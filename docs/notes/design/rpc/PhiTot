Monomer concentrations (physics)

    Let phi_{tot} be the volume fraction occupied by material

    Let p be a polymer type index

    M_{p} = total number of chains of type p

    Possible convention 1:
    ----------------------

      Q_{p} = \int dr q(r,N) / V
  
          [ expression for Q is unchanged, but value goes to roughly Q phi_{tot} ]

      phi(r) = v c (r) 
             = v M_{p} \int ds q(r,s) q^{\dagger}(r,s) / (V Q)
  
      M_{p} N_{p} v = phi_{p} phi_{tot} V 
  
      ->  v M_{p}/V = phi_{p} phi_{tot}/N_{p}
  
      ->  prefactor = phi_{p} phi_{tot} / (N_{p} Q_{p})
  
         [ expression for the prefactor changes ]

      phi(r) = prefactor \int ds q(r,s) q^{\dagger}(r,s)

      mu = \ln( phi_{p} phi_{tot}/ Q)

        [ mu defined such that value of mu is unchanged, but expression changes ]

      ln Z = M_{p} ln (Q V /vN_{p} ) - \ln M_{p}! ]
           = M_{p} [  ln(Q V /vN_{p} ) - ln M_p + 1 ]
           = M_{p} [  ln( V /(M_{p}vN_{p}) + ln Q + 1 ]

      -ln Z = M_{p} [  ln(M_{p} v N_{p} /V ) - ln Q - 1 ]
            = M_{p} [  ln( phi_p ) - ln (Q / phi_tot) - 1 ]

      -ln Z = M_{p} [ mu - 1 ]

       A/(M_{p}N_{p}) = [ mu - 1 ]/N_p

      
    Possible Convention 2: 
    ----------------------

      Q_{p} = \int dr q(r,N) / (phi_{tot}V)
  
      [ Expression for Q is changed, but value is unchanged. ]

      phi(r) = v M_{p} \int ds q q^{dagger} / (\phi_tot V Q)
  
      M_{p} N_p v = phi_{p} phi_{tot} V
  
      prefactor = v M_{p} / (V phi_{tot} Q} = phi_{p}/(N_{p} Q)
  
      [ Expression for prefactor is unchanged. ]

      mu = ln (phi_p / Q)

      [ Both the expression for mu and its value are unchanged. ]
      
      ln Z = M_{p} ln (Q V phi_{tot} /vN_{p} ) - \ln M_{p}! 
           = M_{p} [  ln(Q V phi_tot / vN_{p} ) - ln M_p + 1 ]
           = M_{p} [  ln( V phi_tot /(M_{p}vN_{p}) + ln Q + 1 ]

      
      -ln Z = M_{p} [ ln( M_{p} v N_{p} /V phi_tot ) - ln Q - 1 ]
            = M_{p} [ ln( phi_p ) - ln (Q) - 1 ]
      -ln Z = M_{p} [ mu - 1 ]

       Total is sum of over p

       A = sum_p M_p [ mu - 1 ]

     
       Av/(V phi_tot) = sum_p [ mu - 1 ] (M_p v / V phi_tot )
                      = sum_p phi_p [ mu - 1 ] / N_p

      [ Both the expression for A = -ln Z and its value are unchanged ]

      Note: With convention 2, you change the definition of Q, and other
      expressions are unchanged.

Problem: Prefactors in computations of concentrations and stress

Solver Templates:

  PropagatorTmpl::solve() - solves MDE for one block, requires no prefactor

  PolymerTmpl::compute()
 
       - solves MDE & computes c for all blocks
       - implicitly assumes phi_{tot} = 1.0 (no mask):

           q_ = block(0).propagator(0).computeQ();
           mu_ = log(phi_/q)

Solvers:

  Propagator::solve( ) - solves MDE for one block, unchanged

  Propagator::computeQ() - computes spatial average of q head and tail of partner

  Block::computeConcentration(double prefactor) - computes c for one block

  Block::computeStress(double prefactor) - computes stress for one block


Proposal
========

  * Use convention 2 to define q in Polymer class (change definition of q_)

  * Modify PolymerTmpl::solve 

      - Modify interface to take argument double phiTot, set to 1.0 by default

            [ void PolymerTmpl::solve(double phiTot = 1.0); ]

      - Set q_ = phiTot * block(0).propagator(0).computeQ();

      Note: We do not change function Propagator::computeQ, so that parameter
      is not passed further down than necessary.

  * Modify Polymer::compute interface

       - Modify interface to take additional optional argument phiTot, 1.0 by default

            [ void compute(wFields, double phiTot = 1.0); ]

  * Modify Rpc::Mixture::compute

       - Modify interface to take an optional argument double phiTot = 1.0.

  * Add function Rpc::Mixture::computeFreeEnergy that computes the ideal gas
    contribution to the Helmholtz free energy and grand-canonical free energies
    per monomer. Add accessors to return fHelhmoltzIdeal and pressureIdeal.

  * Add functions System::computeInteractionFreeEnergy, System::computeExternalFreeEnergy.

  * Have System::computeFreeEnergy call Mixture::computeFreeEnergy and accessors, along
    with functions to compute and access interaction and external free energies.

  Comments: 

    - Use of optional phiTot parameters with default values phiTot = 1.0 will allow 
      use of unmodified functions by SCFT implementations in which masks are not 
      (or not yet) implemented.

    - Calculation of ideal gas properties in mixture on a grid will allow free
      energies to be calculated even when using iterators that do not use 
      symmetry adapted functions.
