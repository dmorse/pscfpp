------------------------------------------------------------------------
Docs:

  - Improve developer documentation for parameter IO

  - Write a first draft of a latex theory and algorithms manual section, 
    or publish as an article in a computational science oriented journal.

  - Documentation for building on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Crystallography and Field Files:

  - Change treatment of phases in Basis to explicitly store and 
    manipulate Rational number phases, compute floating point 
    coefficients only at the very end.

  - Introduce a convention in Basis in which pairs of related open stars
    are always listed in the same order (this helps complete the basis 
    field API).

  - Introducing new v2.0 field file formats for basis and rgrid. 
    Basis would contain the mesh. Rgrid mesh nodes would be output in 
    conventional C order.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCFT:

  - Back tracking in Anderson Mixing  ?

  - LrAm iterator for SCFT ?

  - Consider introducing non-locality and compressibility

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PS-FTS:

  - Allow for eigenvalues of projected chi matrix of both signs

  - Move "Interaction" into program level subspaces.

  - Introduce smooth cutoff "damping" function for interactions

  - For simplicity, don't introduce compressibility into PS-FTS.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CL-FTS:

  - Complex Langevin field theoretic simulation (CL-FTS)

  - Design Interaction with chi matrix plus compression modulus, with
    same damping function for all interactions.
