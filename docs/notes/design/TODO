v1.3

Pscf
-----

1) Review and clean up redundant GPU kernels (leave for v1.1?)

2) Change treatment of phases in Basis to explicitly store and 
manipulate Rational number phases, compute floating point coefficients 
only at the very end.

3) Introduce a convention in Basis in which pairs of related open 
stars are always listed in the same order (this helps complete the 
basis field API).

4) Introducing new v2.0 field file formats for basis and rgrid. 
Basis would contain the mesh. Rgrid would be output in convention C 
order.

Docs
-----

1) Write a first draft of a latex algorithms and theory manual, or 
publish as an article in a computational science oriented journal.
