Proposed modification of makefile system to improve building of codes 
that uses GPUs:

1) Add a makefile macro PSCF_CUDA macro to pscf/config.mk file, which 
should be undefined by default and set equal to 1 when active. This
macro should be defined if and only if CUDA code can and should be
compiled.

2) Add a -g option to the configure script to allow the user to enable
or disable GPU code from the command line.

3) Change "all" makefile target to optionally compile pspg if PSCF_CUDA

4) If we later add GPU files to namespace level directories other than
src/pspg, then allow testing of PSCF_CUDA within makefiles to optionally 
compile CUDA files.

5) Add a "configure" script to the pscfpp root directory that applies
any changes to config.mk files in both src/ and bld/ directories.

User manual instructions for compiling would be:

1) Try compiling without setting the -c (CUDA) option to compile only 
CPU code.

2) If you have an appropriate GPU and CUDA development environment, call 
"./configure -c1" from the root directory to enable GPU code and 
recompile by calling "make all".
