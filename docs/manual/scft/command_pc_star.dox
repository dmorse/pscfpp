<BR>

THE WRITE_STARS command accepted by pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs writes
a compact report of information about the stars of wavevectors that are
related by space group symmetries. A more detailed report that contains
information about individual wavevectors within each such star may be
obtained by invoking the \ref scft_command_pc_wave_page "WRITE_WAVES" 
command.

<em> Conceptual background </em>: As background, before reading this 
description of the output of the WRITE_STARS, we strongly recommend
that users read the discussion of the relationships between "stars" 
and basis functions given in the documentation of the 
\ref scft_field_basis_page "basis file format". 
Users who would like a more complete discussion can also consult 
appendices that discuss crystallographic space group 
\ref scft_symmetry_page "symmetry operations" and 
\ref scft_basis_page "symmetry-adapted bases".

<em> For users who examine the source code </em>:
The format of this report is defined by the outputStars function of 
class template Basis<int D>, which is defined in the file 
src/pscf/crystal/Basis.tpp.

\section scft_command_pc_star_format_sec File Format (Overview)

The file created by the WRITE_STARS command contains a header section 
similar to that used for field files, followed by a long data section.
The last line of the header section contains the value for N_basis, 
which is equal to both the total number of uncancelled stars and the 
number of independent basis functions in the symmetry-adapated Fourier 
expansion used by the program that wrote the file. 

The data section contains one line per uncancelled star. Stars are 
listed in order of increasing eigenvalue of the Laplacian as computed
using the unit cell parameters that were available when the basis was
constructed.  A large section of the data section that has been removed 
from this example, as indicated by vertical dots. 

The format of each row of the data section is as follows
\code
   basisId   starId   size  beginId   endId  starInvert  wave[D]  
\endcode
in which:

   - basisId is an integer index for each uncancelled star, or basis 
     function. This index increases by 1 for each row in the data 
     section.

   - starId is an integer index for each star. Values for this
     index are assigned to both cancelled and uncancelled stars,
     but only uncancelled stars are included in this report. The
     starId is the star index reported for each wavevector in the 
     file created by the WRITE_WAVES command.

   - size is the number of waves in the star. 

   - beginId is the wave index (waveId) of the first wave in the star 

   - endId is one greater than the the wave index of the last wave in 
     the star. 

   - starInvert is a integer that can have allowed values of 0, 1, -1.
     A value starInvert = 0 indicates that the star is closed under
     inversion. A value of starInvert = +1 or -1 indicates that the 
     star is the first star (for starInvert = 1) or the second star 
     (for starInvert = -1) in a pair of open stars that are related 
     to one another by inversion. 
 
   - wave[D] is a vector of D integer wave components of a
     characteristic wave that belongs to the star, which can
     be used as an identifier for the star.

The indices beginId and endId list indices of waves in an ordered list 
of all waves, including those that belong to cancelled stars, in which 
the waves that belong to a particular star are listed as a consecutive 
block with indices beginId, ...., endId - 1. Only non-cancelled stars 
are listed in this file format.

Stars are listed in this file output in order of increasing starId.
Pairs of open stars that are related to each other by inversion are
always assigned sequential values for the starId, and thus always
appear sequentially in this format, with the star with starInvert = +1
listed first.

\section scft_command_pc_star_gyroid_sec Example (Double Gyroid) 

An example of the file created by a WRITE_STARS command is shown below 
for a system with space group \f$ I a\overline{3} d \f$, or PSCF space
group identifier I_a_-3_d. This is the space group of the double gyroid
phase of a diblock copolymer. Because this space group is centrosymmetric
(i.e., has an inversion center), all stars are closed under inversion,
and so a value of starInvert = 0 is thus listed for every star. An 
example of the output file created by the MAKE_WAVES command for the 
same system is shown \ref scft_command_pc_star_gyroid_sec "here". 

Because \f$ I a \overline{3} \f$ space group has an inversion center, 
every star of this space group is closed under inversion. For this 
reason, a value of starInvert = 0 is listed for every star in this
example.

\section scft_command_pc_star_altgyr_sec Example (Alternating Gyroid) 

An example of the file created by a WRITE_STARS command is shown below 
for a triblock copolymer system with space group \f$ I 4_{1} 3 2 \f$, 
or PSCF space group identifier I_41_3_2. This is the space group of the 
alternating gyroid phase of an ABC triblock copolymer. 

Unlike the space group of the double gyroid, this space group is not 
centrosymmetric.  As a result, the stars of this space group can include 
open as well as closed stars. Open stars of a non-centrosymmetric group
always exist in pairs that are related by inversion - the wavevectors in
one member of the pair are just the inverses of the wavevectors in the
other. 

By convention, open stars that are related by inversion are always 
assigned consecutive indices. The first member of each such pair is 
assigned a value of starInvert = 1, while the second is assigned
a value starInvert = -1. These pairs of open stars thus show up as 
consecutive rows with starInvert values of 1 and -1, in that order.
The first such pair in this listing is the pair with basisId values 
6 and 7, starId values 14 and 15.  By convention, characteristic waves 
of stars that are related by inversion are chosen to be inverses of 
one another.  Consistent with this, these two stars have characteristic 
waves {3 2 -1} and {-3 -2 1}, respectively.

All of the rows in this file in which starInvert = 0 are associated 
with starts that are closed under inversion despite the fact that 
this symmetry group does not contain an inversion symmetry operation.
