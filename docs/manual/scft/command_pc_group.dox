THE WRITE_GROUP command accepted by pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs writes
a file containing a list of all the symmetry operations of the current 
space group. A discussion of symmetry operations and their representation
is given as an \ref scft_symmetry_page "appendix". A shorter overview is
given here in a form sufficient to allow a user to understand the format
of the file created by the WRITE_GROUP operation. The format used by
the WRITE_GROUP command is the same as that used in the group files that 
are distributed with pscf, which are located in subdirectories of the
data/groups directory.

\section scft_command_pc_group_operations_sec Symmetry Operations

A space group is defined by a set of crystallogrphic symmetry operations.
Every space group symmetry operation \f$ A \f$ is a function that maps
very position vector \f$ {\bf r} \f$ in a \f$ D \f$ dimensional space 
onto a transformed position
\f[
    A({\bf r}) = R{\bf r} + {\bf t} \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ R \f$ is a linear operator that performs a point group 
operation such as a rotation, reflection, or inversion on the vector 
to its right, and \f$ {\bf t} \f$ is a translation vector. 
Symmetry operations for which \f$ {\bf t} = 0 \f$ are referred to as 
<em> symmorphic </em> operations, while those for which 
\f$ {\bf t} \neq 0 \f$ are <em> non-symmorphic </em>. 
Operations involving glide planes and screw axes are non-symmorphic.
The translation vectors for non-symmorphic operations generally always
the position by a rational fraction of a unit cell (e.g., 1/4 or 1/2)
along one or more Bravais lattice basis vectors.

Positions and symmetry operations are most conveniently expressed 
using a Bravais lattice basis vectors, which we refer to as a Bravais 
basis.  Let 
\f[
    {\bf a}_{0}, \ldots, {\bf a}_{D-1} 
\f] 
denote a list of the basis vectors used by PSCF to define the crystal 
Bravais lattice.  Any position may be expanded in a Bravais basis as a 
superposition
\f[
    {\bf r} = \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} r_{i} {\bf a}_{i} \quad,
\f]
in which \f$(r_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1} \f$ are dimensionless components,
which we refer to as reduced coordinates.

Symmetry operations are also conveniently represented using a Bravais 
basis.  Using such a basis, we may represent any point group operation 
\f$ R \f$ as a matrix with integer elements, and a translation 
\f$ {\bf t} \f$ as a vector with components given by rational numbers 
(i.e., fractions such as 1/2, 1/4, 2/3, etc.) 
If a symmetry operation \f$ A \f$ transforms a vector \f$ {\bf r} \f$
onto a transformed vector given by
\f[
    {\bf r}' = A({\bf r}) 
    = \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} r_{i}' {\bf a}_{i} \quad.
\f]
then the components of \f$ {\bf r}' \f$ can be expressed as a sum
\f[
    r_{i}' = 
    \sum_{j=0}^{D-1} R_{ij} r_{j} + t_{i}
\f]
for \f$ i = 0, \ldots, D-1 \f$. 
Here, \f$ R_{ij} \f$ is an element of a matrix representation of 
the point group operation \f$ R \f$ and \f$ t_{i} \f$ is a component 
of the translation vector \f$ {\bf t} \f$, defined in a Bravais 
basis. The matrix elements of \f$ R \f$ in this basis must be integers 
in order to guarantee that this point group operation maps the Bravais 
lattice (i.e., the set of all positions with integer reduced component 
values) onto itself. Components of the transalation vectors for 
non-symmorphic operations are always fractions such as multiples of 
1/2, 1/4 or 1/3 or multiples thereof when defined in a Bravais
basis.

\section scft_command_pc_group_format_sec File Format

The output of the WRITE_GROUP command displays a list of symmetry
operations in which each operation for a three-dimensional crystal is 
listed as a block of the form
\code
    R(0,0) R(0,1) R(0,2)
    R(1,0) R(1,1) R(1,2)
    R(2,0) R(2,1) R(2,2)
    t(0)   t(1)   t(2)
\endcode
in which we use R(i,j) to denote \f$ R_{ij} \f$ and t(i) to 
denote \f$ t_{i} \f$. Nonzero components of the translation vector 
are written as rational fractions, in the form I/J, where i is an
integer and J is an nonzero fractional integer, with J=2,3 or 4.
The formats for one- and two-dimensional space group operations 
are analogous, and generally contain D columns and D+1 rows to
display a symmetry operation of a  D dimensional crystal.

The first two lines of each group file give the dimension of space 
and the number of symmetry operations in the group. The dimension of 
space is denoted by a label "dim". The number of symmetry operations 
in the group is denoted by a label "size".  These two lines are 
followed by a list of all symmetry operations, each of which is 
output int the format shown above, with one empty line between 
successive symmetry operations. The order in which symmetry 
operations are listed has no significance - a group is a set of 
operations, defined without regard to order.

\section scft_command_pc_group_example_sec Example

An example is shown below of the file created by the WRITE_GROUP 
command for a system with space group \f$ Ia\overline{3}d \f$. 
The resulting file is identical to that distributed with the PSCF
package as the file pscfpp/data/groups/3/I_a_-3_d .
