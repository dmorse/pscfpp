The thermodynamic properties obtained for a converged SCFT solution are output
by PSCF in a standard format that we refer to a thermo file block, or simply a
thermo block.  A thermo block can also be written to a specified file by the
WRITE_THERMO command.  A thermo block also appears within the log information
that is written to standard output during execution of an ITERATE command, as
well as within each of the \ref scft_thermo_state_sec "state" files that are
created by a SWEEP command.

The following section discusses each of the entries in this file format,
describing the meaning of each property and the units and conventions
used to define its numerical value.

\section scft_thermo_energetic_sec Properties

\subsection scft_thermo_helmholtz_sub Helmholtz free energy

The property "fHelmholtz" is a non-dimensional form of the Helmholtz free
energy, which will be denoted here by the symbol \f$ \tilde{f} \f$.  The
reported value is actually the free energy per monomer reference volume in
thermal energy units. That is, the value reported for "fHelmholtz" for a
system with a total Helmholtz free energy \f$ F \f$ and associated volume
\f$ V \f$ is given by ratio
\f[
    \tilde{f} \equiv \frac{Fv}{Vk_{B}T}
\f]
where \f$ v \f$ is the monomer reference volume.

In the special case of a one-component block polymer melt for which 
the input parameters are given using the 
\ref user_model_conventions_theorist_sec "theorists convention" that 
overall chain length is equal to 1.0, the monomer reference volume is 
equal to the volume per chain. In this case, the value reported for 
"fHelmholtz" is also the free energy per chain
in thermal energy units, with \f$ k_{B}T = 1 \f$. More generally, in a
mixture, one can obtain the free energy associated with the volume
occupied by a molecular species by multiplying the overall contour length
(for polymers) or size (for solvents) of the species by the value
reported for "fHelmholtz".

\subsection scft_thermo_pressure_sub Pressure and grand-canonical free energy

The property "pressure" reported by PSCF is a non-dimensionalized
thermodynamic pressure that is computed from the value of the
grand-canonical free energy density. Consider a system that contains a
total of \f$ N_{a} \f$ molecules of molecular species \f$ a \f$, and let
\f$ \mu_{a} \f$ denote the chemical potential of species \f$ a \f$, for
each polymer and solvent species.  Let \f$ \Phi \f$ denote the so-called
"grand" or "grand-canonical" free energy, defined as
\f[
   \Phi \equiv F - \sum_{a}\mu_{a}N_{a} \quad,
\f]
in which the sum is taken over all polymer and solvent molecular species
in the system. We define a thermodynamic pressure \f$ P \f$ via the
identity
\f[
    \Phi = -PV  \quad,
\f]
where \f$ V \f$ is total system volume. The property reported by PSCF
as "pressure", which is denoted here by the symbol \f$ \tilde{p} \f$,
is actually the value of the ratio
\f[
    \tilde{p} = \frac{Pv}{k_{B}T} = -\frac{\Phi v}{Vk_{B}T} \quad.
\f]
The value of pressure reported by PSCF is thus \f$ -1 \f$ times the
grand-canonical free energy per monomer reference volume, in thermal
energy units.

\subsection scft_thermo_f_components_sub Free energy components

The next two parameters, "fIdeal" and "fInter", are individual components
of the Helmholtz free energy. "fInter" is an interaction free energy,
representing the contribution to the Helmholtz free energy arising from
interactions between dissimilar monomer species. "fIdeal" is the
contribution to the Helmholtz free energy from everything else. This can
be thought of as the free energy of a non-interacting ideal gas of
polymers in the self-consistent chemical potential fields.

In calculations with an external field, a third term will appear here:
"fExt". This represents the contribution to the Helmholtz free energy
arising from interactions between the monomer species and the external
potential fields.

\subsection scft_thermo_species_sub Polymer and solvent species

The next two sections of the example given above are labeled "polymers"
and "solvents". These are lists, with one row per chemical species, in
which each row gives the species index, the overall volume fraction "phi",
and the chemical potential "mu" of that chemical species. Note that the
chemical potential values are in thermal energy units, so the numerical
value reported for species \f$ a \f$ actually \f$ \mu_{a} / k_{B}T \f$.

\subsection scft_thermo_params_sub Lattice parameters

The final section, labeled "cellParams", lists the lattice parameters
for the converged SCFT solution. This section appears in the output
of SCFT calculations for periodic systems performed using pscf_pc or
pscf_pg programs. It does not appear in the output of calculations
for one-dimensional systems performed using pscf_1d, since the domain
size is fixed by the user in pscf_1d calculations. In pscf_pc and pscf_pg
calculations, some or all of the lattice parameters may be flexible, and
are adjusted during the SCFT calculation so as to minimize the free
energy density. In this case, the converged values of lattice parameters
values that are allowed to vary are important output of the calculation.
If an SCFT calculation is run with no flexible lattice parameters (i.e.,
a rigid unit cell) this section of the thermo block simply reports the
lattice parameters values that were used as inputs.  Input values for
lattice parameters are normally provided within the header block of the
file used to provide an initial guess for the monomer chemical potential
fields (the w fields). The lattice parameters are reported in whatever
\ref user_model_parameters_length_sec "length units" were used in the 
input field and parameter files.

\section scft_thermo_state_sec State files

A "state" file is a type of file that is created for each state (i.e., each
set of input parameters) during a \ref scft_sweep_page "parameter sweep" 
performed by a SWEEP command. Each such state file is comprised of a 
parameter file block followed by a thermo file block. The parameter file 
block contains the input parameters used for the SCFT calculation at that 
state, with the Sweep block excluded, formatted in the nested 
curly-bracket syntax of a PSCF parameter file. The thermo block contains 
thermodynamic properties computed for the converged solution. Each state 
file thus gives all of the input <i>and</i> output parameters for a single 
calculation.  Names of state files that are generated by a SWEEP command 
contain an integer index followed by the file extension ".stt".

A state file can also be generated for an individual calculation
(as opposed to a parameter sweep) by using the command WRITE_PARAM
followed by the command WRITE_THERMO, while using the same file name
argument for both commands. In the command file, this might look like
\code
WRITE_PARAM    out/state
WRITE_THERMO   out/state
\endcode
The WRITE_THERMO command is designed to append to the end of an
existing file rather than overwrite it in order to allow both blocks
to be written to a single file.

An example of the format of a state file is shown below for a system that
forms a lamellar phase of a diblock copolymer in a selective solvent.
