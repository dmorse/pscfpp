<BR>

THE WRITE_WAVES command accepted by pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs writes a 
detailed description of the symmetry-adapted basis used by these programs. 
Closely related information about the basis is also provided by the
\ref scft_command_pc_star_page "WRITE_STARS" command.

<em> Conceptual background </em>: As background, before reading this 
description of the output of the WRTIE_WAVES command, we strongly recommend
that users read the discussion of the relationships between "stars" and 
basis functions given in the documentation of the 
\ref scft_field_basis_page "basis file format". 
Users who seek a more complete discussion can also consult appendices 
that discuss crystallographic space group
\ref scft_symmetry_page "symmetry operations" and
\ref scft_basis_page "symmetry-adapted bases".

The type of symmetry-adapated Fourier basis used by the pscf_pc and
pscf_pg programs is constructed by grouping all of the reciprocal lattice
wavevectors used in a discrete Fourier transform of periodic functions 
into subsets of wavevectors that are related to one another by space 
group symmetry operations. 
We refer to each such subset of symmetry-related wavevectors as a 
\ref scft_field_basis_star_sec "star" of wavevectors.
A basis function that is invariant under all operations of the space group, 
known as a \ref scft_field_basis_starfunc_defn "star function", is created 
as a linear superposition of waves with wavevectors that belong to each 
\ref scft_field_basis_uncancelled_sub "uncancelled" star. 
The report created by the WRITE_WAVES command writes a list of all of 
wavevectors that belong to uncancelled stars, in which the row associated 
with each wavevector gives integer indices for the wavevector, the integer 
index of the star to which that wavevector belongs, and the coefficients 
of the corresponding wave within the associated star function 

<em> For users who examine the source code </em>:
The format of this report is defined by the outputWaves function of class 
template Basis<int D>, which is defined in the file 
src/pscf/crystal/Basis.tpp. 

\section scft_command_pc_wave_format_sec File Format

The file created by the MAKE_WAVES command contains a header section 
similar to that used for field files followed by a long data section.
The last line of the data section contains the value for N_wave, which 
is the total number of wavevectors listed in the data section.

The data section contains one row for each reciprocal lattice wavevector 
that belongs to an uncancelled star. 
Wavevectors that belong to \ref scft_field_basis_cancelled_sub "cancelled"
stars are omitted.
Waves that belong to the same star are are assigned a continuous block of 
values for the index waveId, and are listed as a consecutive block within 
this file. 
Because all of the wavevectors in a star are related by symmetry 
operations such as rotations and reflections, they are all reciprocal
lattice vectors of equal magnitude. 
Stars appear in increasing (or non-decreasing) order of the magnitude
of the constituent wavevectors, as computed using the unit cell 
parameters that were available when the basis was constructed.

The format of each row of the data section is as follows
\code
     i  waveId  components[D]  starId  Re(c)   Im(c)
\endcode
in which:
   
   - i is an integer index that increases by one for each row in the 
     data section. This is thus an integer index for uncancelled
     waves.

   - waveId is a unique integer index for each wavevector that is 
     assigned to waves that belong to both cancelled and uncancelled 
     stars.  Because the output created by MAKE_WAVES only includes 
     wavevectors that belong to uncancelled stars, the lsting of 
     values of this index has gaps that correspond to sets of waves 
     that belong to cancelled stars.

   - components[D] is a vector of D integer wave components of the 
     wave in a basis of reciprocal lattice basis vectors, where
     D = 1, 2 or 3 is the dimension of space. 

   - starId is the index of the star to which the wave belong

   - Re(c) and Im(c) are the real and imaginary parts of the
     complex coefficient of the wave within a star function
     (i.e., a basis function associated with this star)

Please see the resources recommended above for definitions of what
we mean by a star, a cancelled star, and a star function.

\section scft_command_pc_wave_gyroid_sec Example (Gyroid Phase) 

An example of the file created by a WRITE_WAVES command is shown below 
for a system with space group \f$ I a\overline{3} d \f$, or PSCF space 
group identifier I_a_-3_d. This is the space group of the double gyroid 
phase of a diblock copolymer. A long section has been removed from the
data section of this file, as indicated by vertical dots. 

The first row of the data section in this example (waveId = 0) represents 
the zero wavevector, with integer components (0,0,0). This is the only 
wave in the first star, which has a starId = 0. Every space group has a
star consisting of just the zero vector, which is always the first line
in the output of the WRITE_WAVES command.

The next 24 rows (with i = 1, ..., 24 and waveId = 57, ..., 80) represent 
wavevectors that belong to the {2,1,1} family of wavevectors, which all 
belong to a star with starId = 6. This is the first star of nonzero 
wavevectors that is allowed by the rules for systematic cancellations
in crystals with this space group.

The next 12 rows (with i = 25, ..., 36 and waveId = 81, ..., 92) represent 
wavevectors that belong to the {2,2,0} family of wavevectors, which all 
belong to a star with starId = 6. This is the first star of nonzero 
wavevectors that is allowed by the rules for systematic cancellations
in crystals with this space group.

Stars of wavevectors for a cubic crystal are always sets of wavevectors
with indices that are related to a list (h, k, l) by permutation and
changes in sign of the indices. The number of wavevectors in such a star 
is equal to 48 if h, k, l and all distinct and nonzero, and can be less
than 48 if some of the indices are equal and/or zero, as is true for the
{211} and {220} stars.

Waves belonging to stars with starId values 1,...,5, which have waveId
values 1, ..., 56, are not listed in this file because these stars are 
all cancelled stars (corresponding to families of wavevectors that
exhibit systematic cancellation in scattering experiments), and thus 
cannot be used to construct symmetry-adapted basis functions. 

The space group used in this example has an inversion center at the 
origin. The existence of an inversion center at the origin can be 
shown to always leads to star functions for which the coefficient of 
every star is a real number. This is why the last column, which gives 
the imaginary part of this coefficient for each wave, is zero in every 
row of the data section.
