An external matlab package named 
<a href="https://github.com/kdorfmanUMN/polymer_visual">Polymer Visual</a>
is available for visualization and plotting of periodic microstructures
predicted by PSCF.  This package is designed to allow users of PSCF to 
generate figures that characterize the kinds of periodic structures 
predicted by the pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs. Polymer Visual can read 
files containing the monomer concentration fields written in the 
\ref scft_field_rgrid_page "r-grid" field file format used by pscf_pc 
and pscf_pg, and can generate several different types of color plots. 
Among the possible outputs are plots that show monomer volume fractions 
along one- and two-dimensional cuts through a structure, and 
three-dimensional perspective plots that show isosurfaces of monomer
volume fraction fields.

Polymer Visual is written as a package of MATLAB functions. It may be 
cloned or downloaded as a zip file from the github repository 
<a href="https://github.com/kdorfmanUMN/polymer_visual"> github.com/kdorfmanUMN/polymer_visual </a>.
The main web page of that repository provides a complete user manual, 
which includes examples of the different types of plots that can be 
generated.
