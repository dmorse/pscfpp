\section scft_environment_overview_sec Overview

The SCFT iterators used by pscf_pc and pscf_pg allow users to define two
different types of externally imposed fields to describe situations in
which a polymeric material interacts with an inhomogeneous environment. A
"mask" field is used to describe geometric confinement to a specified
region in a manner that does not distinguish among different monomer types.
External potential fields instead specify monomer-specific potential energy
landscapes that can induce preferential accumulation of particular monomer
types in specific locations. The two features can be used together to
allow SCFT calculations to describe situations in which a material is
confined to a region, such a thin film, in which the confining surfaces
exhibit preferential wetting, using external fields that are nonzero only
in narrow regions near the confining surfaces to induce wetting. As
described below, a mask field is implemented as a modification of the
incompressibility constraint, whereas the external fields are implemented
via addition of an external field term to the self-consistent field
equation for each monomer type. The resulting framework is designed to be
quite general and extensible by users. The current version of PSCF is
distributed with a set of tools that use this framework to simulate
confinement of polymer to a thin film with chemically homogeneous but
selective top and bottom surfaces.

We refer to a mask and a set of external fields collectively as "imposed 
fields" for a given SCFT calculation, and we define an "environment" to be
the set of imposed fields for a given calculation. These imposed fields 
can be defined by either of two methods:

  - Mask and external fields can be defined in field files that are
    created separately by the user, which can be read into PSCF using 
    any of several commands that are designed for this purpose, as 
    described below and in the \ref scft_command_pc_page "commands" 
    page. 

  - Mask and external fields may be generated within the PSCF software
    using an \ref scft_environment_class_sec "Environment" object that
    reads parameters specific to a particular type of environment from
    the parameter file (e.g., the thickness of a film and parameters that
    describe the strength of preferential wetting) and generates an 
    appropriate set of imposed fields internally, within the software.

PSCF is currently distributed with an Environment that can generate imposed
fields for simulating thin films with preferential wetting.  Thin films are
simulated using a "supercell" that contains alternating regions of polymer
and vacuum, as defined by a periodic "mask" field.  This thin film field
generator is described in detail on the 
\ref scft_thin_films_page "Thin Films" page. 

The declared space-group symmetry of an SCFT calculation with imposed 
fields must be chosen so as to guarantee that the mask and external 
fields are invariant under all elements of the declared space group. 
The space group that best describes a given system is that which contains 
every symmetry operation shared by the mask, the external fields, and 
the polymer morphology itself; this is typically a lower-symmetry space 
group than that of the bulk polymer morphology that would be formed in 
the absence of any imposed fields. The choice of an appropriate 
space-group for a thin film morphology that is defined in a periodic 
super-cell is discussed in the \ref scft_thin_films_page "Thin Films" 
page. 

\section scft_environment_mask_sec Mask field

The iterators used in pscf_pc and pscf_pg allow users to define a "mask"
field that imposes geometric confinement within the unit cell by modifying
the incompressibility constraint. A mask field is a dimensionless function
of position, denoted here by \f$ m({\bf r}) \f$, that has a value very
close to 1 throughout a region to which the polymer material is confined
and a value very close to 0 throughout a region from which the material is
being excluded. The incompressibility constraint for a system that is
subjected to a mask is modified so as to require that
\f[
   v \sum_{\alpha=1} c_\alpha({\bf r}) = m({\bf r})
\f]
at every point in the system, where \f$ m({\bf r}) \f$ is the mask field,
\f$ c_{\alpha}({\bf r}) \f$ average is the number concentration of monomers 
of type \f$ \alpha \f$ at point \f$ {\bf r} \f$, \f$ v \f$ is the monomer 
reference volume, and the summation is over all distinct monomer types. 
Introduction of a mask provides a simple way to impose geometric confinement 
within a program that is designed for periodic systems. The mask can have 
any functional form as long as it satisfies the periodic boundary condition 
and the space-group symmetry of the system.

Let \f$ \phi_{\alpha}({\bf r}) \f$ denote the product
\f[
   \phi_{\alpha}({\bf r}) = v c_{\alpha}({\bf r}) 
\f]
of monomer reference volume and average monomer concentration, which we
refer to as the monomer volume fraction for monomers of type \f$ \alpha \f$. 
In a system with a mask, the sum of the monomer volume fractions at position 
\f$ {\bf r} \f$ is thus constrained to equal to \f$ m({\bf r}) \f$, rather 
than unity.

Let \f$ \overline{m} \f$ denote the spatial average of the mask function 
\f$ m({\bf r}) \f$ over the computational unit cell, given by the ratio
\f[
   \overline{m} = \frac{1}{V} \int d{\bf r} \; m({\bf r}) \quad,
\f]
where the integral is taken over the entire computational unit cell of 
total volume \f$ V \f$ that includes regions from which the polymer is 
excluded.  The quantity \f$ \overline{m} \f$ is thus the fraction of the 
unit cell volume that is occupied by polymer material, while the product
\f$ \overline{m} V \f$ is the total volume with the unit cell occupied 
by material. 

A user-defined mask may be set by using a command to read the mask field
from a file. The command READ_MASK_BASIS reads a file in which the mask
field is specified using the symmetry-adapted basis file format, thus
defining a field that is guaranteed to exhibit the declared space group
symmetry.  The READ_MASK_RGRID command instead reads a file in which a mask
is defined using the r-grid format as a list values on nodes of the
relevant grid, for which the file format does not impose any symmetry. The
READ_MASK_BASIS command must be used to initialize a mask for any SCFT
calculation in which the iterator explicitly imposes a space-group
symmetry, by using an internal representation of w-fields using a
symmetry-adapated basis. 

\section scft_environment_external_sec External fields

The pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs also allows users to define an external
potential field associated with each type of monomer in the system. In what
follows, let \f$ h_{\alpha}({\bf r}) \f$ denote the external field imposed
on monomers of type \f$ \alpha \f$.  When nonzero external fields have been
set, the self-consistent field equation for monomers of type \f$ \alpha \f$
becomes 
\f[
   w_{\alpha}({\bf r})
   = \sum_{\beta} \chi_{\alpha\beta} \phi_{\beta}({\bf r})
   + \xi({\bf r}) + h_{\alpha}({\bf r}) \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ \xi ({\bf r}) \f$ is the Lagrange multiplier local pressure 
field that imposes incompressibility, \f$ \chi_{\alpha\beta} \f$ is the 
binary Flory-Huggins interaction parameter for  monomers of types 
\f$ \alpha \f$ and \f$ \beta \f$, and 
\f$ \phi_{\beta}({\bf r}) = v c_{\beta}({\bf r}) \f$ is the local volume
fraction of monomers of type \f$ \beta \f$. The external fields can also 
assume any form as long as they satisfy the periodic boundary condition 
and the declared space-group symmetry of the calculation.

A list of external fields for all monomer types may be set by using a 
command to read these fields from a single file. The READ_H_BASIS command 
reads a file in which these fields are defined using a symmetry-adapted 
basis, creating fields that guaranteed to be invariant under all elements 
of a declared space group, whild READ_H_RGRID read a field file that uses 
the r-grid format, for which the format does not impose any symmetry.
External fields for an SCFT calculation in which symmetry is imposed by 
the iterator must be symmetric, and so must be set using the READ_H_BASIS 
command. 

\section scft_environment_class_sec Environment objects

When studying a specific class of problems, such as polymer thin films, 
it is convenient for appropriate mask and external fields to be generated 
algorithmically within the PSCF software, based on numerical values of a 
few parameters that are provided by the user within the parameter file.  
This can be done by the use of an Environment object that is designed for
such a class of problems.

An Environment object may be created by the user by including an optional 
Environment block of the parameter file that precedes the Iterator block. 
The name of the Environment block will vary depending on the type of
environment to be imposed, and the corresponding parameters inside of the
Environment block will vary as well. 

An example is provided below for a FilmEnvironment object used to impose
thin-film confinement, which is currently the only available type of
Environment object:
\code
  FilmEnvironment{
    normalVecId  2
    interfaceThickness 0.2
    excludedThickness  0.4
    chiBottom[
                       0
                       10
    ]
    chiTop[
                       0
                       0
    ]
  }
\endcode
In this example, the parameter block is named "FilmEnvironment" and
contains 5 input parameters required to define a mask and external fields
appropriate to a polymer thin film problem, named normalVecId,
interfaceThickness, excludedThickness, chiBottom and chiTop. The
FilmEnvironment object is described in detail in the \ref
scft_thin_films_page "Thin Films" page. 

One advantage of the use of an Environment to programmatically generate a
mask and external fields is that this method allows these imposed fields to
be automatically recomputed during a calculation as needed. Regeneration of
the fields can sometimes be required by changes in the unit cell
parameters. The design of the Environment class also allows some
specialized parameters that are defined within the associated parameter
file block to be declared to be varied during an SCFT parameter sweep,
which generally requires recomputation of the mask or external fields
before each SCFT calculation within the sweep.  For example, for thin
films, the chiBottom and chiTop parameters that control preferential
wetting along the bottom and top surfaces to be varied during a linear
parameter sweep, which requires repeated recomputation of the associated
external fields.

\section scft_environment_freeenergy_sec Modified free energy calculation

In the presence of imposed mask and external fields, it is necessary to 
modify the free energy calculation to account for the fields.  The free 
energy per monomer of material is given by
\f[
   \tilde{f} = \tilde{f}_{\rm id} + \tilde{f}_{\rm int} + \tilde{f}_{\rm ext}
\f]
where
\f{eqnarray*}
    \tilde{f}_{\rm id}
    & = & \sum_{i=0}^{P+S-1} \frac{\overline{\phi}_{i}}{\overline{m} L_{i}}
    \left[ \ln \left( \frac{\overline{\phi}_{i}}{\overline{m} Q_{i}}\right) 
     - 1 \right]
     - \frac{1}{\overline{m} V}
       \sum_{\alpha=0}^{C-1}
       \int \! d\textbf{r} \;
       w_{\alpha}(\textbf{r})
      \phi_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}) \\
    \tilde{f}_{\rm int}
    & = &  \frac{1}{2 \overline{m} V} \sum_{\alpha, \beta =0}^{C-1}
    \chi_{\alpha\beta} \int \! d\textbf{r} \;
    \phi_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}) \phi_{\beta}(\textbf{r}) \\
    \tilde{f}_{\rm ext} 
    & = &  \frac{1}{\overline{m}V} \sum_{\alpha=0}^{C-1}
    \int \! d\textbf{r} \;
       h_{\alpha}(\textbf{r})
      \phi_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}) \quad.
\f}
Here, \f$ \phi_{\alpha}({\bf r}) = v c_{\alpha}({\bf r}) \f$ is the local 
volume fraction of monomer type \f$ \alpha \f$ at position **r** , while 
\f$ \overline{\phi_{i}} \f$ is the spatial average volume fraction of 
molecular species \f$ i \f$ across the entire unit cell.
These quantities are defined such that the sum of values of 
\f$ \phi_{\alpha}({\bf r}) \f$ over all monomer types is equal to 
\f$ m({\bf r}) \f$ (as discussed \ref scft_environment_mask_sec "above"), 
while the sum of values of \f$ \overline{\phi}_{i} \f$ over all molecular 
species is equal to \f$ \overline{m} \f$.

There are three changes in the above equations relative to those that 
describe systems in the absence of imposed fields 
(see \ref scft_propagator_thermo_sec "here"). 

   - There is an additional term, \f$ \tilde{f}_{\rm ext} \f$, that contains 
     the average energy per monomer arising from interaction of monomers 
     with associated external potential fields. In any calculation that uses 
     external fields, this property is output as "fExt" along with the 
     \ref scft_thermo_page "other thermodynamic properties".

   - The overall volume fraction \f$ \overline{\phi_i} \f$ is replaced by 
     \f$ \overline{\phi_i}/\overline{m} \f$ within the expression for
     \f$ \tilde{f}_{\rm id} \f$. In a system containing a mask, in which 
     the sum of species volume fractions \f$ \overline{\phi}_i \f$ is 
     equal to \f$ \overline{m} \f$ rather than unity, the ratio 
     \f$ \overline{\phi}_{i}/\overline{m} \f$ represents the fraction of 
     the material volume that is occupied by molecular species \f$ i \f$.

   - The volume \f$ \overline{m}V \f$ that is occupied by material is
     used to normalize spatial integrals, rather than the volume \f$ V \f$ 
     of the computational unit cell, which includes regions from which
     polymer material is excluded by the mask.  Note that the material 
     volume \f$ \overline{m}V \f$ is also used to normalize the spatial 
     integral used to define \f$ Q_i \f$ in a system with a mask.
