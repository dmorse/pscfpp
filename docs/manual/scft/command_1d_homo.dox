The COMPARE_HOMOGENEOUS command computes differences between properties of 
an inhomogeneous system of interest, as predicted by SCFT, and those of an
homogeneous reference system. The command takes an integer mode parameter,
as discussed below. 

\section scft_command_1d_homo_mode_sec  Mode Parameter

The integer mode parameter, which takes allowed values of 0, 1, and 2, 
determines the nature of the homogeneous reference system to which the
system of interest is compared:

  - In mode 0 (i.e., when mode == 0), the pscf_1d program considers a
    homogeneous reference system with the same overall (i.e., spatial 
    average) volume fraction for each molecular species as that of the 
    actual system. 

  - In modes 1 and 2, the program uses a homogeneous reference system in 
    which the chemical potentials for all species are equal to those of 
    in the actual system.  

The only difference between modes 1 and 2 is how the composition of the 
reference system is computed. In both cases, the composition of the
reference system is computed by iteratively solving for a list of species
volume fractions for which the chemical potentials have values equal to
those of the actual system. Under some circumstances of interest, the 
solution to this problem is not unique - in systems that are susceptible
to phase separation into two or more phases, there can exist two or more
compositions that yield the same list of chemical potentials. Because the
composition is computed, when this is true, the calculated composition of
the reference system may depend on the choice of an initial guess. The
only difference between modes 1 and 2 is a difference in the choice of
initial guess of composition used for this iterative solution. In mode 
1 the initial guess is chosen so as to give a volume fraction for each
equal to the local volume fraction for all monomers of that species at
the last grid point in the SCFT solution.  In mode 2, the initial guess 
is instead chosen so as to give a composition equal to that found at the 
first grid point. 

\section scft_command_1d_homo_phi_sec  Output Data (Equal Composition)

In mode 0, an output report is written to standard output that includes
the non-dimensional free energy per monomer "f(homo)" of the homogeneous 
reference system, difference "delta f" between values of free energy per 
monomer of the actual and reference system. These an all other free 
energies are output using energy units with \f$ k_{B}T = 1 \f$. Free
energies per monomer are computed by multiplying the free energy density
(total free energy divided by total system volume) by the monomer volume.

The output for mode 0 also contains values of the chemical potential
"mu(homo)" and the species volume fraction "phi(homo)" for each polymer
and solvent species in the homogneous reference system.

For calculations that are performed using a Cartesian coordinate system,
the value of the total system volume V(tot) is is actually the length 
xmax - xmin of the calculation domain along a direction perpendicular to 
the interface, or the volume per unit interfacial area. Correspondingly, 
the values of "Phi (ex)" and "F (ex)" reported in this case are actually 
values of free energy per unit interfacial area, in thermal energy units, 
while values of "deltaV" for each species are excess volumes per unit 
area.

For calculations that are performed using a cylindrical coordinate system,
the value of the total system "volume" is actually the area of the domain,
while values of excess free energies and excess volumes for individual
species are also reported as excess free energy per unit length or excess 
volume per unit length (i.e., excess area) along the axis of rotation of 
the cylindrically symmetric system.

\section scft_command_1d_homo_mu_sec  Output Data (Equal Chemical Potential)

In modes 1 and 2, the first part of the output report contains 
non-dimensional values of the following overall thermodynamic properties:

   - f(homo)  : Helmholtz free energy per monomer in homogeneous reference
   - p(homo)  : pressure x monomer volume in homogeneous reference
   - delta f  : difference between values of f (actual - homogeneous)
   - delta p  : difference between values of p (actual - homogeneous)
   - F (ex)   : total excess Helmholtz free energy
   - Phi (ex) : total excess grand-canonical free energy
   - V(tot)/v : Ratio of system volume to monomer reference volume

Total excess properties are computed by taking the difference between the
value in the inhomogemeous system of interest and that of a homogeneous
reference system with the same volume and equal values for all chemical 
potentials.  The value of F (ex) is equal to the value of "delta f" times 
"V(tot)/v".  The value of Phi (ex) is equal to -1 times "delta p" times 
"V(tot)/v". 

The following properties of specific species are also output for each
species:

   - mu        : species chemical potential
   - phi(homo) : species volume fraction in homogeneous reference system
   - deltaV    : Total excess volume of a species

The total excess volume associated with a species can be interpreted as 
a spatial integral of an excess volume fraction.  In an incompressible 
system, the sum of values of deltaV for different species must add to 
zero. 

Values of system volumes and total excess properties have the same 
interpretation as for mode 0: In Cartesian coordinates, "V(tot)" is 
actually a length (volume per area), and excess properties are computed 
per unit area, whereas in cylindrical coordintes "V(tot)" is actually
an area, while excess properties are reported as values per unit length
along the axis of symmetry. 

\section scft_command_1d_homo_micelle_sec  Micelle Properties

Properties of spherical and cylindrical micelles can be computed by
performing a SCFT calculation in spherical or cylindrical coordinates
for a cylindrical or spherical geometry that includes the origin in
which a micelles is surrounded by a solvent rich region is large 
enough to be homogeneous near the outer edge of the computational 
domain (i.e., near the last grid point). Excess properties of micelles 
can be computed by invoking the COMPARE_HOMOGENEOUS command 1 to obtain 
a homogeneous reference system with a composition similar to that of 
the solvent-rich region that surrounds the micelle. 

\section scft_command_1d_homo_interface_sec Interfacial Properties

Interfacial properties can be computed by simulating a system that 
contains two bulk-like phases separated by an interface, and using mode 
1 or 2 to compare it to a homogeneous reference system of equal chemical 
potentials.  

In the case of a flat interface that is treated in Cartesian coordinates,
the interfacial tension is given in thermal energy units by the reported
value of "Phi (ex)". For such a flat interface, the same value for this
excess grand-canonical free energy should be obtained using either mode 
1 or mode 2, because the conditions for mechanical equilibrium require 
that the same value of pressure (and thus the same grand-canonical free 
energy density) must be obtained in the two coexisting bulk phases. 
To compute other excess interfacial properties (e.g., excess Helmholtz 
free energy and excess volume per interfacial area for each species), 
however, the user to choose a convention to define a Gibbs dividing 
surface, and to perform some calculations that are not automatically
perfomed by the COMPARE_HOMOGENEOUS command. 

Computation of any excess property for a curved cylindrical or spherical
interface, including interfacial tension, requires the user to define a
Gibbs dividing surface and perform some additional calculations beyond
those performed by this command. 

As a first step in a computation of excess interfacial properties that 
require the  definition of a Gibbs dividing surface, it is sometimes useful 
for a user to first invoke COMPARE_HOMOGENEOUS command twice with different
mode parameter values of 1 and 2. The resulting outputs provide values of 
species volume fractions and free energy densities in homogemeous systems
with compositions that correspond to those of the two bulk phases that are 
separated by the interface.
