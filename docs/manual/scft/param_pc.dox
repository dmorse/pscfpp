<BR>

The pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs for periodic systems use nearly identical
parameter file formats, and so are discussed together here. The description
given here only covers required and optional elements relevant to SCFT
calculations. A complete description of the parameter file format for either
of these programs, including optional elements that not relevant to SCFT, is 
given \ref rpc_System_page "here". 

\section scft_param_pc_example_sec Example

The example show below is a typical parameter file for using pscf_pc to 
perform a SCFT calculation for a 3D perodic structure of known space group 
symmetry of a diblock copolymer melt. This example would also be accepted 
by the pscf_pg program, which would perform the same calculation while
offloading some parts of the calculation to a GPU.

\code
System{
  polymerModel thread
  Mixture{
    nMonomer  2
    monomers[
              1.0
              1.0
    ]
    nPolymer  1
    Polymer{
      type    linear
      nBlock  2
      blocks[
              0  0.15
              1  0.85
      ]
      phi     1.0
    }
    ds   0.01
  }
  Interaction{
    chi(
          1   0   25.0
    )
  }
  Domain{
    mesh             32  32  32
    lattice          cubic
    groupName        I_m_-3_m
  }
  Iterator{
    epsilon      1e-10
    maxItr       100
    maxHist      50
    isFlexible   1
  }
}
\endcode
This parameter file is designed to initialize a single SCFT calculation
for a BCC phase of a single-component diblock copolymer melt.  A parameter 
file for SCFT calculation of a mixture could contain more than one 
"Polymer" blocks and/or one or more "Solvent" blocks. A parameter file to 
initialize a parameter Sweep would contain an additional "Sweep" block. 

\section scft_param_pc_system_sec File format

The format of a parameter file used by pscf_pc or pscf_pg to perform a
an SCFT calculation is shown in skeleton from below:
\code
System{
  polymerModel*   enumeration  ("thread" or "bead", "thread" by default)
  Mixture{ ...  }
  Interaction{ ...  }
  Domain{ ...  }
  Environment#*{ ...  }
  Iterator#*{ ... }
  Sweep#*{ ... }
}
\endcode
The above skeleton includes only blocks that are relevant for SCFT 
calculations, and excludes optional elements that are only relevant to 
PS-FTS calculations. A complete description of the format for the main 
System block is given \ref rpc_System_page "here". 

<b> polymerModel </b>: The polymerModel entry is an optional enumeration
parameter with allowed values of "Thread" and "Bead" that specify global 
use of either the continuous thread or discrete bead model.  If this 
parameter is omitted, the thread model is used by default. 

<b> Iterator and Sweep </b>: The Iterator and Sweep blocks are both 
optional and selectable, but an Iterator block must be present in order 
to perform an SCFT calculation.  The Sweep block is only needed if one 
intends to peform an SCFT parameter sweep. 

Formats of the Mixture and Interaction blocks are the same for all PSCF 
programs, and have thus been discussed previously. Below, we discuss the 
contents of the Domain, Iterator, and Sweep blocks.

\section scft_param_pc_domain_sec Domain block

The Domain block contains information required to describe the unit cell 
of a periodic structure, the regular mesh that is used to discretize 
fields within each unit cell, and (optionally) an identifier for the space 
group of the desired solution.  The parameter file format is discussed 
below, as well as in separate page \subpage rpc_Domain_page "here".

An example of the format of this block is shown below:
\code
  Domain{
    mesh        32  32  32
    lattice     cubic
    groupName   I_m_-3_m
  }
\endcode
The format for this block is
\code
Domain{
   mesh        [int(D)] (D integer elements)
   lattice     string
   groupName*  string
}
\endcode
The groupName parameter is optional, but must be included to enable
SCFT calculations that seek a solution of specified space group symmetry. 
The mesh and groupName parameter lines are discussed separately below.

<b> mesh  </b>

The value of the variable "mesh" is a vector of integers on a single
line that specify the number of grid points along each direction of the 
uniform spatial mesh used to discretize fields within each unit cell of 
the crystal.  The number of integers is equal to the dimensionality D 
of the periodic unit cell.  The format is
\code
   mesh   N[0] .... N[D-1]
\endcode
where N[i] is the number of grid points along axis number i, for
i = 0 ,..., D-1.

The dimensions N[0], ... , N[D-1] of the spatial mesh are initialized to
in the parameter file and are immutable thereafter. The only way to run
simulations with different mesh sizes is to run pscf_pc and pscf_pg 
multiple times using different parameters files with different values 
for the mesh parameter.

<b> lattice </b>

The value of the parameter "lattice" is given by string that specifies the
desired crystal system type.  The set of allowed values for this string
depends on the dimensionality of space.  There are 7 allowed values of
the lattice string for a 3D structure, corresponding to the 7 types of
3D crystal system, with names given by the strings "cubic", "tetragonal",
"orthorhombic", "hexagonal", "rhombohedral", "monoclinic", and "triclinic".
The allowed values for a 2D system include "square", "rectangular",
"hexagonal" "rhombic" and "oblique".  There is only one allowed lattice
system for a 1D crystal, which is referred to as  "lamellar". A more 
detailed discussion of each of the possible lattice systems is given in 
a separate page that documents conventions for
\ref scft_unitcell_page "unit cells".

The lattice system parameter is initialized by the parameter file and
is immutable thereafter.

<b> groupName </b>

The "spaceGroup" is an optional string parameter that, if present,
identifies the crystallographic space group for the structure of 
interest.  Each allowed value of the groupName string corresponds 
to a modified version of the name of a space group, as listed in 
the international tables of crystallography. In the above example, 
the groupName string I_m_-3_m is a modified form of the name
\f$Im\overline{3}m\f$ for the space group for a BCC lattice. PSCF
uses a set of conventions for converting an international table 
symbol for a space group into a text string that involve insertion
of underbars between logical elements and the use of - sign to 
represent an overbar, among other conventions. Allowed identifiers 
for crystallographic space groups are listed and discussed in more
detail \ref scft_groups_page "here".

If groupName identifer is present, it is used construct a space group
(i.e., a set of symmetry operations) and a symmetry-adapted Fourier
basis. A symmetry-adapted Fourier basis is a set of functions of 
position that are all eigenfunctions of the Laplacian and are all 
invariant under all symmetry operations in the specified space group,
which can be used as a basis for expanding functions with the specified
symmetry. The algorithm used to construct such a basis requires 
knowledge of a set of initial values for the unit cell parameters. 
This symmetry-adapted basis is thus normally constructed immediately 
after the first time unit cell parameters are initialized, e.g., by 
reading the values given in a file that contains a description of a 
field.

If a groupName parameter is present in the parameter file, it is
immutable after the parameter file is processed. Simulations of 
structures with different space groups must be performed separately,
by running pscf_pc or pscf_pg multiple times with different parameter
files. 

<b> Unit cell parameters (absence from parameter file) </b>

To completely describe the Bravais lattice for a crystal with a known 
crystal system, one must assign values to a list of unit cell parameters 
that give the lengths of the edges of the unit cell and, for some lattice 
systems, angles between some of these edges.  The number of unit cell 
parameters required to describe a unit cell is different for different 
lattice system. For example, a 3D cubic crystal can be described using 
a single parameter that gives the length of any edge of a simple cubic 
unit cell. Three parameters are required to describe an orthorhombic 
unit cell, to specify lengths of three orthogonal Bravais basis vectors, 
while 6 parameters are required for a triclinic unit cell, to specify 3 
independent unit cell lengths and 3 angles. The unit cell parameters for 
each unit cell type are stored internally in an array that lists the 
required parameters in some pre-specified order. Conventions for the 
meaning of the required parameters and the order in which they are 
listed are described for each crystal system in a separate page of 
documentation about \ref scft_unitcell_page "unit cells".

Values for unit cell parameters are specified within the header section 
of files that describe periodic chemical potential fields (w-fields) or 
monomer concentration fields (c-cields). Values for these parameters 
are not, however, provided in the parameter file.  Unit cell parameters 
are thus normally first assigned values during execution of the first 
command in the command file that causes the program to set the chemical 
potential fields for the program, by reading these fields from a file.
Unit cell parameters can also be set explicitly using a command named
SET_UNIT_CELL users may invoke to manually set or reset the unit cell 
parameter values at any point during processing of a command file. 

If the Domain block of the parameter file contains a space group name, 
a symmetry-adapted Fourier basis for that space group is constructed 
immediately after the first time that unit cell parameters are assigned 
initial values by either mechanism, e.g., either the first time that
the w-fields are set by reading these fields from a file or the 
SET_UNIT_CELL command is invoked). 

Unit cell parameters for a crystal are changed many times during SCFT 
calculations for systems with flexible unit cells, in which the unit 
cell parameters are adjusted so as to minimize the free energy density. 
At the end of such a calculation, converged values for the optimal 
unit cell parameters are normally output within the header of a file 
that contains the converged w-fields.

\section scft_param_pc_environment_sec Environment

The Environment block is an optional selectable block that can be used
to define a mask and/or external potential fields in order to define 
an inhomogeneous externally imposed environment, as described in detail
\ref scft_environment_page "here". An environment can be used to describe 
a confined environment such as that experienced by a 
\ref scft_thin_films_page "thin film".
This block is not needed for standard SCFT calculations involving bulk 
periodic phases.

\section scft_param_pc_iterator_sec Iterators

The default Iterator for the pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs is based on an 
algorithm that uses an \ref pscf_AmIteratorTmpl_page "Anderson mixing" (AM)
iterator algorithm, and is designed to maintain a specified space group 
symmetry.  This default iterator can be invoked in pscf_pc using either 
the generic label "Iterator" or the specific label "AmIteratorBasis". 
This is currently the only iterator available in pscf_pc.  A description 
of the parameter file format for this iterator is given 
\subpage rpc_AmIteratorBasis_page "here".

The \ref rpc_AmIteratorBasis_page "AmIteratorBasis" iterator is designed 
to search for a solution with a specified space group symmetry, and can 
only be used with a parameter file that contains a groupName parameter.
The pscf_pg program provides an analogous symmetry-preserving iterator, 
also named \ref rpg_AmIteratorBasis_page "AmIteratorBasis", but also 
provides a second Anderson-Mixing algorithm named 
\ref rpg_AmIteratorGrid_page "AmIteratorGrid" that does not impose any 
space-group symmetry.

The Iterator block of the parameter file is formally optional (i.e., the 
program will finish reading the parameter file if it is omitted), but is 
required to enable SCFT calculations. An Iterator block is not needed to 
peform a field theoretic simulation.

\section scft_param_pc_sweep_sec Sweep

The Sweep block is another a block that (like the Iterator block for 
pscf_pc) has been programmed as a selectable block, but for which there is 
currently only one available algorithm.  The only sweep algorithm that is 
currently available for use with either pscf_pc or pscf_pg is a general 
linear sweep algorithm, which is also the default algorithm.  Such a 
linear sweep can thus be enabled by including a block that starts either 
with the generic label "Sweep" (as done in any examples shown here that 
include a sweep block) or the specific label "LinearSweep". The format 
of the associated parameter file block is described 
\ref scft_param_sweep_linear_sec "here".
