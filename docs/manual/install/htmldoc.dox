<BR>

The html documentation that you are reading was generated using the
<a href=http://www.doxygen.org> doxygen </a> documentation utility. The
git repository that contains the source code for PSCF contains all of the
source files required to construct this documentation but does not contain
the resulting html files.

\section install_doc_generate_sec Generating documentation

If the doxygen program is installed on your machine, you can us it to generate
a local copy of this html manual.  To check whether doxygen is installed, enter
\code
which doxygen
\endcode
 from the command line. If a valid path to a file named doxygen is returned,
then doxygen is already installed. If doxygen is not installed, install it
before proceeding, either using an appropriate package manager or by
downloading from the doxygen web page.

Once doxygen is installed, simply change directory to the PSCF root
directory and enter
\code
make html
\endcode
The resulting html files will be installed in the pscfpp/docs/html/
directory.

The computer on which you generate the documentation will need to have an
active internet connection in order for some mathematical expressions to be
formatted correctly. This is a result of the use of the MathJax interpreter
provided by a server to format mathematical formulas throughout this manual.

\section install_doc_read_sec Reading local documentation

The main page of the html documentation is a file named docs/html/index.html.
To begin reading your local copy of the documentation, simply open this file
in any web browser. To read the documentation on a linux system using the
firefox browser, enter
\code
firefox docs/html/index.html
\endcode
from the PSCF root directory. On a Mac, one can instead use the "open"
command to open this file with the default web browser by entering
\code
open docs/html/index.html
\endcode
from the PSCF root directory. Alternatively, one can use the Finder to
navigate to the pscfpp/docs/html folder, double click on any file in that
directory with an *.html file extension, and then click on the "main page"
button in the upper left to go to the main page (i.e., the index.html page).

\section install_doc_source_sec Manual source files

The text of the main manual pages, including the page you are now reading,
is contained in a set of files with file extension *.dox in the docs/manual
directory. These are written in plain text with a few formatting commands,
and can also be read with any text editor. Files in the src/ directory with
the file name suffixes *.dox or *.mod contain other parts of the web manual
documentation.  In addditional, API documentation for each C++ class and
function is extracted by doxygen from formatted documentation blocks that
have been added to every C++ header file.

\section install_doc_clean_sec Cleaning up

To delete all html documentation from the docs/html directory and start
over, enter
\code
make clean-html
\endcode
from the PSCF root directory. Equivalently, one may enter "make clean"
from the PSCF docs directory.
