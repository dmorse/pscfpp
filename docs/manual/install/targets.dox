The build system for PSCF is based on unix makefiles. Individual programs
or groups of programs may be compiled by invoking the "make" command with
an appropriate target name, using the syntax
\code
make target
\endcode
where "target" represents a target name such as "all-cpu" or "pspg".

The make utility may be invoked from either the pscfpp/src/ or pscfpp/bld/ 
directories, or from the pscfpp/ root directory, using a common set of
main target names in all three cases. Invoking make from the pscfpp/ root
with a target that causes compilation generally has the same effect as 
invoking it from the pscfpp/bld directory with the same target, and
initiates out-of-source compilation that creates intermediate files in 
the pscfpp/bld/ directory tree.  Invoking make from within the pscfpp/src/ 
directory will instead initiate an in-source compilation that creates 
intermediate files in the src/ directory, alongside the source files. 
Makefile targets that create executable scft programs all install the 
resulting executable files in the pscfpp/bin directory, no matter where
the make command is invoked from.

On this page, we explain the most important makefile targets in more detail 
than was given in the \ref install_overview_page "overview of instructions".
The following instructions assume that you have already made the required 
changes to environment variables and run the setup script before using
make to compile. 

\section install_targets_main_sec Compilation 

All of the makefile targets described below can be invoked either from
the pscfpp/ or pscfpp/bld/ directory to perform out-of-source compilation, 
or from the src/ directory to perform in-source compilation. 

<h2> fd1d: </h2>

The fd1d target compiles the pscf_fd 1D finite difference program.  
The only dependency of this program is the GSL library.  To compile 
just this program, simply enter:
\code
make fd1d
\endcode
If entered before compiling any other code, this command will:

  - Compile a large number *.cpp files in the util/, pscf/ and fd1d/ 
    namespace-level subdirectories of the src/ directory.

  - Install corresponding object (*.o) and dependency (*.d) files in 
    corresponding locations within the chosen build directory (i.e.,
    in either the bld/ or src/ directory)

  - Create a static library (with file extension *.a) in each of these 
    three namespace-level subdirectories of the build directory.

  - Install an executable file named pscf_fd in the pscfpp/bin 
    directory. 

To recompile these programs after making any changes to configuration
files (e.g., after enabling or disabling the debugging feature or 
changing compiler command line options), simply reissue the "make fd1d" 
command.  The build system will detect if you have changed any of the 
relevant configuration files, and will recompile any file that might 
be effected by such changes.

<h2> pspc: </h2>
The pspc makefile target compiles the pscf_pc1, pscf_pc2, and pscf_pc3
pseudo-spectral programs for periodic microstructures on a CPU. These
programs depend on both the GSL library and the FFTW fast Fourier 
transform libraries.  To compile these programs, enter:
\code
make pspc
\endcode
from the pscfpp/, pscfpp/bld or pscfpp/src directory.
This command will cause the system to:

  - As needed, compile all *.cpp files in the src/util/ and src/pscf/ 
    directories that have not been previously compiled, and, if necessary, 
    create associated static library files in these directories.

  - Compile all of the *.cpp files in the src/pspc/ directory, and create
    create a corresponding static library file there.
    
  - Install executable program file named pscf_pc1, pscf_pc2, and 
    pscf_pc3 in the pscfpp/bin directory. 

The three resulting three programs are used for problems structures that 
are periodic in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, respectively. One would thus use 
pscf_pc1 to simulate a lamellar (one-dimensional) structure, pscf_pc2 
to simulate a hexagonal cylinder (two-dimension structure), or pscf_pc3 
to simulate a fully three-dimensional structure such a BCC or gyroid 
structure.

<h2> all-cpu: </h2>

To compile and build all CPU-based programs, but not any GPU-enable programs, 
enter
\code
make all-cpu
\endcode
This is equivalent to entering "make fd1d" followed by "make pspc". 

<h2> pspg: </h2>

The pspg makefile target compiles the pscf_pg1, pscf_pg2, and pscf_pg3
GPU-enabled pseudo-spectral programs for periodic microstructures. To
compile these programs on a computer with an appropriate NVIDIA GPU and
the NVCC Cuda compiler, enter
\code
make pspg
\endcode
from either the pscfpp root directory or the desired build directory. 
If successful, this will compile code from the pspg/ subdirectory of 
the src/ directory, place object, dependency and library files in 
subdirectories of the chosen build tree, and install executables for 
1, 2, and 3 dimensional problems named pscf_pg1, pscf_pg2 and pscf_pg3 
in the pscfpp/bin directory.

This target does not check whether CUDA compilation has been enabled
(by defining PSCF_CUDA), will fail if invoked on a machine that does not 
support CUDA compilation.  

<h2> all: </h2>
To build all CPU programs and build GPU-enabled programs if and only if 
CUDA compilation has been enabled, enter
\code
make all
\endcode
The action taken this target depends on whether CUDA compilation has 
been enabled, which can be done either by using the 
\ref install_configure_page "configure script" or by editing a 
configuration file. This command is equivalent to calling
"make all-cpu" followed by "make pspg" if and only if CUDA is enabled.

\section install_targets_clean_sec Clean-up 

The following targets remove files in order to clean up after compilation, 
rather than creating files.

<h2> clean: </h2>
If, for any reason, you would like to clean up after compiling by 
removing all of the object, dependency and library files that are 
generated during compilation, you may enter
\code
make clean
\endcode
from either the chosen build directory or from the pscfpp/ root 
directory.  The clean target removes all the intermediate files generated 
by compilation, but does not remove the final executable files or the 
configuration files that were created by the setup command.  
If "make clean" is invoked from the pscfpp/ root directory, it removes 
all such intermediate files in both the bld/ and src/ directory. If 
"make clean" is invoked from the src/ or bld/ directory, it only 
removes such files from the directory from which it is invoked.

The "make clean" command can also be invoked from almost any 
subdirectory of the src/ directory tree in order to remove recursively
remove intermediate files from that directory and its subdirectories. 
The "make clean" command can also be invoked from namespace level 
subdirectories of the bld/ directory, with the same effect.

<h2> clean-bin: </h2> 
The "clean-bin" command removes all of the pscf executable files
named pscf_* that are created by compilation and normally installed 
in the pscfpp/bin directory. It does not remove other executable
scripts that are installed in the bin/ directory by the setup 
script. 

<h2> clean-docs: </h2> 
The "clean-docs" command removes any files that have been generated 
in the docs/ directory by the doxygen documentation generation 
utility, including all of the html files that are created in the 
docs/html directory.

<h2> veryclean: </h2>
The "make clean" and "make clean-bin" commands discussed above remove 
files that are generated by compilation, but do not remove the various 
files that are installed by the setup script, which include various
makefile fragments and C++ files.  To remove these files in addition 
to all of those removed by the "clean", "clean-bin" and "clean-docs" 
targets, enter 
\code
make veryclean
\endcode
from the pscfpp/ root directory. This command returns the pscfpp/ 
directory tree to a state very similar to the state it had 
immediately after the repository was created by cloning a remote
repository.

After you run "make veryclean", you will need to rerun the setup
script before attempting to compile any code.

The "veryclean" target erases almost all of the files that are generated
by the setup script, compilation, and the documentation generator. There
are, however, a few types of files that do not exist in the repository
but that it will not erase. Specifically, it will not erase any local
compiler setup files files that the user may have created in the 
make/compiler directory. After invoking "make veryclean", a user can 
thus invoke setup with the name of a previously created compiler setup
file as an argument in order to recreate a similar initial configuration.

\section install_targets_makeall_sec Invoking make from within src/

When compiling in-source, by invoking make from within the src/ directory 
tree, users may also invoke "make all" from a subdirectory of src/ in 
order to compile a smaller set of source files. Invoking the command 
\code
make all
\endcode
from almost any subdirectory of the src/ directory tree  will compile 
all C++ files in the tree rooted at that subdirectory, without compiling
any code outside of that subdirectory.

Invoking "make all" from a subdirectory of a namespace level directory
(i.e., a subdirectory of the src/util, src/pscf, src/fd1d, src/pspc, or 
src/pspg directory) will generally compile all the *.cpp and *.cu source 
files in that directory and any nested subdirectories.

Invoking "make all" from any namespace level subdirectory of src/ will
not only compile of all the *.cpp and *.cu source files in the namespace 
level directory tree, but will also create a static library file containing 
all of the resulting object code, and then build and install executables 
for any programs for which the source files are in that directory.  For 
example, entering "make all" from src/fd1d directory will create a static 
library named src/fd1d/libfd1d.a, and install an executable named pscf_fd 
in the bin/ directory. 

<em> Rationale </em>: The ability to invoke "make all" from any subdirectory 
of src/ is designed to allow developers to use the command line to easily 
recompile a few files from rom within the directory in which they are 
working.  Typically, when a developer is adding a new feature or fixing 
a bug, he or she will be usually be actively editing only a few files 
within a single subdirectory of the src/ directory. Other files in the
same subdirectory will usually be left untouched during this process.
The system for keeping track of dependencies used by the PSCF build 
system guarantees that invoking "make all" from the directory containing 
the the files of immediate interest will only recompile source files that 
have recently been modified, that include header files that have recently 
been modified, or that have not already been compiled. A common work flow 
during development for those who work from a command line is thus to edit 
a file, exit the editor, then invoke "make all" from the directory 
containing that file to check if the modified file compiles.

<em> Comment </em>: Invoking make with the name of a single file as a 
target (e.g., with the name of a *.o object file) generally does *not* 
work as intended, unless one uses the absolute path to the file. The 
reason for this is that patterns and dependency files used by the pscf 
makefile system all use absolute paths. The build system thus may not 
recognize a relative path to a file as equivalent to the absolute paths 
used in the files that define makefile patterns and dependencies among 
files. Consistent use of "make all" for in-source compilation avoids
this limitation, because "make all" causes the "make" utility to try to 
compile a list of source files whose locations are provided internally 
as absolute paths.
