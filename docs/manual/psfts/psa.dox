In a field theoretic treatment of an incompressible system, the
partial-saddle approximation (PSA) is an approximation for the
treatment of the pressure like field that acts to constrain the 
total density. When it is applicable, the approximation yields a
theory with real statistical weights for all allowed field 
configurations.

\section psfts_psa_ab_sec AB Systems (\f$ M = 2 \f$)

We first consider the PSA for an incompressible standard AB system with 
\f$ \chi > 0 \f$.  In the fully fluctuating theory for such a system, 
the partition function can be expressed as an functional integral over 
a real exchange field \f$ W_{-} \f$ and an imaginary pressure-like 
field \f$ W_{-}({\bf r}) = i\omega_{+} \f$.  

In the PSA for such a system, \f$ Z \f$ is approximated by functional
integral with respect to \f$ W_{-} \f$ in which the Hamiltonian 
\f$ H \f$ is evaluated in a configuration in which \f$ W_{+} \f$ is 
chosen so as to give a vanishing partial functional derivative of
\f$ H \f$ with respect to \f$ W_{+}({\bf r}) \f$. 
This yields an approximate for the partition function as an integal
\f[
   Z = \frac{1}{N} \int DW_{-} \; e^{-H[ W_{-}, W_{+}^{*}]}
\f]
in which \f$ \int D W_{-} \f$ denotes a functional integral over 
the exchange field \f$ W_{-} \f$, while \f$ W_{+}^{*} \f$ denotes 
a configuration of \f$ W_{+}({\bf r}) \f$ that is chosen to satisfy 
the so-called partial-saddle point condition
\f[
    0 = \left .  \frac{ \delta H } { \delta W_{+}({\bf r}) } 
    \right |_{W_{-}}
    =  \frac{1}{v} 
   \left [ \phi_{1}{\bf r}) + \phi_{2}({\bf r}) - 1\right ]
\f]
for all \f$ {\bf r} \f$.
Note that this condition is satisfied if and only if
\f$ \phi_{1}({\bf r}) + \phi_{2}({\bf r}) = 1 \f$. 
Partial saddle-point field configurations thus satisfy a mean-field
version of the incompressibility constraint that is identical to 
the form of this constraint used in SCFT. SCFT solutions also satisfy
the requirement that \f$ \delta H/\delta W_{-}({\bf r}) = 0 \f$, 
however, while PS-FTS methods allow \f$ W_{-}({\bf r}) \f$ to 
fluctuate.

Partial saddle-point field configuration for states characterized
by a real-valued exchange field \f$ W_{-}({\bf r}) \f$ always have
a real-valued field \f$ W_{+}({\bf r}) \f$, corresponding to a pure 
imaginary value of \f$ \omega_{+}({\bf r}) \f$.
Such a field configurations always yield real monomer w-fields fields, 
given by
\f[
   w_{1}({\bf r}) =  W^{*}_{+}({\bf r}) + W_{-}({\bf r})  \quad
\f]
\f[
   w_{2}({\bf r}) =  W^{*}_{+}({\bf r}) - W_{-}({\bf r})  \quad.
\f]
Partial saddle-point field configurations are also characterized
by real values for \f$ \ln Z_{\rm id}[w] \f$ and the Hamiltonian 
\f$ H \f$. 

\section psfts_psa_general_sec General Case (\f$ M \geq 2 \f$)

The current version of PSCF allows PS-FTS simulations of some 
systems with M > 2, subject to a constraint on allowed values of the 
\f$ \chi \f$ parameters:  The implementation of the PSA in the current 
version of PSCF is applicable if and only if the nontrivial eigenvalues 
of the projected \f$ \chi \f$ matrix, 
\f$ \lambda_{1}, \ldots , \lambda_{M-1} \f$,
are all negative.  When applied a standard AB system, this is 
equivalent to a requirement that \f$ \chi > 0 \f$. In general, when
this condition is satisfied, then \f$ \sigma_{i} = 1 \f$, and thus
\f[ 
   W_{\alpha}({\bf r}) = \omega_{\alpha}({\bf r}) + S_{\alpha}
\f]
for all \f$ \alpha = 1, \ldots, M - 1 \f$, giving real values for all 
these fields. Because \f$ W_{\alpha} \f$ and \f$ \omega_{\alpha} \f$
then only differ by a constant shift for these fields, any 
functional integrals with respect to \f$ \omega_{\alpha} \f$ with 
\f$ \alpha < M \f$ can be re-written as an integral with respect 
to \f$ W_{\alpha} \f$ without changing the integral.

To discuss the generalized PSA for such systems, it is convenient to 
adopt a modified notation analogous to that used for AB systems, in
which we use \f$ W_{-} \f$ as short-hand for the list of fields
\f[
   W_{-} = [W_{1}, \ldots, W_{M-1}] \quad,
\f]
which we refer to collectively as exchange fields, while using 
\f$ W_{+} \f$ as an alternate symbol for the pressure-like field 
\f$ W_{M} \f$. Using this notation, we may express the generalized 
PSA for such systems as an integral 
\f[
   Z = \frac{1}{N} \int D W_{-} \; e^{-H[W_{-}, W_{+}^{*}]}
\f]
in which \f$ \int DW_{-} \f$ denotes a functional integral over 
the \f$ M - 1 \f$ real exchange fields 
\f$ W_{-} = [W_1, \ldots, W_{M-1}] \f$, and in which 
\f$ W_{+}^{*} \f$ denotes a real-valued configuration of 
\f$ W_{+}({\bf r}) \f$ that is chosen to satisfy a partial
saddle-point condition requiring that
\f[
    0 = \left . 
    \frac{ \delta H }
         { \delta W_{+}({\bf r}) } 
    \right |_{W_{-}}
\f]
for all \f$ {\bf r} \f$.
This partial saddle-point criterion can be shown to be equivalent 
to a requirement that 
\f[
    \sum_{i=}^{M} \phi_{i}({\bf r}) = 1
    \quad.
\f]
In the case considered here, for which 
\f$ \lambda_{1}, \ldots, \lambda_{M-1} \f$ are all negative, the 
partial saddle-point approximation yields real values for all average 
monomer fields \f$ \phi_{1}({\bf r}), \ldots \phi_{M}({\bf r}) \f$ and
for the Hamiltonian \f$ H \f$ in all allowed field configurations.

<b> Status of Algorithms for \f$ M > 2 \f$: </b>

The BD and MC algorithms currently provided PSCF can perform simulations 
of systems with \f$ M \geq 2 \f$ if and only if the projected chi matrix 
has no positive eigenvalues. This statement applies both to the actual BD 
and MC algorithms used to generate random changes in exchange fields and 
to the \ref psfts_algorithm_compressor_sec "compressor" algorithms used 
to identify partial saddle points. For ABC systems, this requirement 
imposes several constraints on the allowed ranges of values of the chi 
parameters, as discussed in the article by
<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.macromol.4c02636">
Morse, Yong and Chen </a>.

Some of the data analysis algorithms provided in the current version of 
PSCF were, however, designed specifically for systems with \f$ M = 2 \f$ 
and are only usable with such systems.  The "analyzer" class that implements 
each such restricted algorithm checks whether \f$ M = 2 \f$, and will print 
an error message and then halt execution before entering the main simulation
loop if a user attempts to apply it to a system with \f$ M > 2 \f$. 
Currently, it is thus possible to perform PS-FTS calculations on some ABC 
systems, but some data analysis algorithms cannot be used for this purpose.

Morse, Yong and Chen have proposed a further generalization of the PSA 
so as to treat cases in which one or more of the \f$ M - 1 \f$ nontrival 
eigenvalues of the projected \f$ \chi \f$ matrix are positive. 
Specificially, they proposed treating the auxiliary fields associated with 
such eigenvalues in a PSA, in addition to the use of the PSA for the 
pressure-like field \f$ W_{M} \f$.  This generalized version of the PSA 
is not implemented in the current version of PSCF, in which the PSA is 
currently only applied to \f$ W_{M} \f$.
