The PS-FTS simulation method used in PSCF is derived by applying a
partial saddle-point approximation to an exact fully-fluctuating field 
theory formulation for an incompressible polymer fluid.  The fully
fluctuating field theory is discussed on this page, while the partial
saddle-point approximation is considered on the next page. Throughout 
this discussion, as elsewhere, we use units for energy in which 
\f$ k_{B} T = 1 \f$.

\section psfts_theory_model_sec Incompressible Particle-Based Model

We consider a mixture of polymers and solvents constructed from \f$ M \f$
different types of monomer. The variable \f$ M \f$ used in this discussion
is equivalent to the parameter nMonomer that appears in a PSCF parameter
file.  Let \f$ c_{i}({\bf r}) \f$ denote the concentration of monomers of
type \f$ i \f$ at point \f$ {\bf r} \f$ within the mixture in a specific
mechanical microstate of the underlying particle based model.

The implementation of PS-FTS in PSCF is designed for an incompressible
model in which the monomer concentrations are assumed to always satisfy
an incompressibility constraint,
\f[
   \sum_{i=1}^{M} c_{i}({\bf r}) = c_{0} \quad,
\f]
for all \f$ {\bf r} \f$ , where \f$ c_{0} \f$ is the specified total
mononer concentration. Let
\f[
   v = 1/c_{0}
\f]
denote the corresponding monomer reference volume. A value for 
\f$ v \f$ is given in the PSCF parameter file by the parameter vMonomer.

The potential energy in any mechanical microstate that satisfies the
incompressibility constraint is taken to be of the form
\f[
   U = U_{\rm id} + U_{\rm int}
   \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ U_{\rm id} \f$ is the intramolecular potential energy of a 
gas of non-interacting molecules, while
\f[
   U_{\rm int}
    =  \frac{v}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^{M} 
   \int d{\bf r} \; \chi_{ij} c_{i}({\bf r}) c_{j}({\bf r})
\f]
is a non-bonded pair interaction energy with local interactions.  Here,
\f$ \chi_{ij} \f$ denotes an element of a symmetric \f$ M \times M \f$
matrix of dimensionless Flory-Huggins interaction parameters.  

The partition function \f$ Z \f$ for such an incompressible fluid can be
expressed to within an irrelevant multiplicative constant as a
configurational integral
\f[
   Z =
       \int {\cal D}{\bf r} \;
        \exp \left ( -U_{\rm id} - U_{\rm int}  \right )
       \;
       \delta \left ( \sum_{i=1}^{M} c_{i}({\bf r}) - c_{0} \right )
   \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ \int {\cal D}{\bf r} \f$ denotes an integral over all
monomer positions, and in which the \f$ \delta \f$-functional imposes
the incompressibility constraint.

\section psfts_theory_ideal_sec Ideal-Gas Reference System

All of the theoretical methods implemented in PSCF relate the free energy
of an interacting polymer fluids to that of a hypothetical reference
system of non-interacting molecules that are subjected to a set of
external fields.
In this ideal gas reference system, each monomer of type \f$ i \f$ is
subjected to a potential field \f$ w_{i}({\bf r}) \f$, for each
\f$ i = 1, \ldots, M \f$.
The potential energy for this system is given by a sum
\f[
    U = U_{\rm id} + U_{\rm c}
\f]
in which \f$ U_{\rm id} \f$ denotes the intramolecular potential energy
of non-interacting chains, and \f$ U_{\rm c} \f$ is an energy arising
from coupling to the external fields, of the form
\f[
   U_{\rm c} = \sum_{i=1}^{M} \int \! d{\bf r} \;
   c_{i}({\bf r}) w_{i}({\bf r}) \quad.
\f]
Let \f$ Z_{\rm id}[w] \f$ denote the partition function for such a gas,
expressed as a functional functional of the fields
\f$ w_{1}, \ldots, w_{M} \f$.
This is given by the configurational integral
\f[
   Z_{\rm id}[w]
    = \int {\cal D}{\bf r} \; e^{-U_{\rm id} - U_{\rm c} }
   \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ {\cal D}{\bf r} \f$ denotes an integral over all monomer
positions.

Let the notation \f$ \langle \cdots \rangle_{\rm id} \f$ denote an
equilibrium ensemble average evaluated for this hypothetical ideal
gas system. Because the properties of the ideal gas depend on the
applied fields, the results of such an average is always a functional
of the fields \f$ w_{1}, \ldots, w_{M} \f$.
Let \f$ \phi_{i}({\bf r})\f$ for any \f$ i, \alpha = 1, \ldots, M \f$
denote a non-dimensionalized average concentration, or average volume
fraction, given by
\f[
    \phi_{i}({\bf r}) = v \langle c_{i}({\bf r}) \rangle_{\rm id}
    \quad,
\f]
where \f$ v \f$ is the monoer reference volume in the incompressible
system of interest.

It is straightforward to show that the functional differentiation of the
free energy \f$ -\ln Z_{\rm id}[w] \f$ with respect to a single field
\f$ w_{i}({\bf r}) \f$ yields an average ideal-gas monomer concentration
\f[
   -\frac{\delta \ln Z_{\rm id}[w]}{\delta w_{i}({\bf r})}
   = \langle c_{i}({\bf r}) \rangle_{\rm id}
   = \phi_{i}({\bf r})/v
\f]
for any \f$ i = 1, \ldots, M \f$.

\section psfts_theory_AB_sec Field Theory: Standard AB Systems (\f$ M=2 \f$)

We focus first on the commonly studied case of systems with two monomer
types, \f$ M = 2\f$.  For simplicity, we consider a model in which the chi
matrix has vanishing diagonal components, \f$ \chi_{11} = \chi_{22} = 0 \f$,
and we use the symbol \f$ \chi \f$ to denote the value of either
off-diagonal element,
\f[
     \chi = \chi_{12} = \chi_{21} \quad.
\f]
We hereafter refer to such systems (with two monomer types and vanishing
interaction matrix elements) as standard AB systems.  The interaction 
potential energy of such a system is given by
\f[
   U_{\rm int}
   =  v 
   \int d{\bf r} \; \chi c_{1}({\bf r}) c_{2}({\bf r})
   \quad.
\f]
At the time of writing of these notes (March 2024), all published PS-FTS 
calculations had simulated such a standard AB systems.

For such systems, it is convenient to define concentration components
\f[
  C_{-}({\bf r}) = c_{1}({\bf r}) - c_{2}({\bf r})
  \quad\quad
  C_{+}({\bf r}) = c_{1}({\bf r}) + c_{2}({\bf r}) \quad.
\f]
Note that the incompressibility constraint requires that
\f$ C_{+}({\bf r}) = c_{0} \f$ for all \f$ {\bf r} \f$, but allows 
\f$ C_{-}({\bf r}) \f$ to fluctuate.
Rewriting \f$ U_{\rm int} \f$ in terms of these variables yields
\f[
   U_{\rm int}
   =  \frac{v}{4}
   \int d{\bf r}  \; \chi
   [ \; c_{0}^{2} - C_{-}^{2}({\bf r}) \; ]
   \quad,
\f]
where we have set \f$ C_{+}({\bf r}) = c_{0} \f$ within the integrand 
for states that satisfy the incompressibility constraint.

<b> Particle-Field Transformation: </b>

We restrict our attention in the remainder of this section to standard 
AB systems with \f$ \chi > 0 \f$. For such systems, a Hubbard-Stratonivich
transformation may be used to rewrite the factor of 
\f$ \exp( -U_{\rm int} ) \f$ in the configurational integral that defines 
\f$ Z \f$ as a functional integral
\f[
   e^{-U_{\rm int} }
   =  \frac{1}{N}
   \int {\cal D} W_{-}
   \exp \left \{ -
   \int \! d{\bf r} \; \left [  \;
    \frac{ W_{-}^{2}}{ v \chi}
          + W_{-} C_{-}
          + \frac{\chi}{4 v} \;
   \right ] \right \}
   \; ,
\f]
in which \f$ \int {\cal D} W_{-} \f$ denotes a functional integral over 
a real-valued auxiliary field \f$ W_{-}({\bf r}) \f$, and where
\f[
   N \equiv
   \int {\cal D} W_{-}
   \exp \left \{
   - \int \! d{\bf r} \;
   \frac{ W_{-}^{2}({\bf r}) }{v \chi }
   \right \}
\f]
is a constant.

The \f$ \delta \f$-functional that constrains the total monomer
concentration in our expression for \f$ Z \f$ may also be expressed
as a functional integral
\f[
   \delta(C_{+}({\bf r}) - c_{0}) =
   \int {\cal D}\omega_{+} \exp \left \{
   - i \int d{\bf r} \; \omega_{+} [ \; C_{+} - c_{0} \; ]
   \right \}
\f]
in which \f$ \omega_{+}({\bf r}) \f$ is a fluctuating real-valued
Lagrange multplier field that imposes the constraint, and
\f$ \int {\cal D}\omega_{+} \f$ denotes a functional integral over
this field.

By substituting the above functional integral expressions for the
\f$ e^{-U_{\rm int}} \f$ and the \f$ \delta \f$-function into the 
definition of the \f$ Z \f$, we obtain a functional integral over 
both \f$ W_{-} \f$ and \f$ \omega_{+} \f$, giving
\f[
   Z = N^{-1}
   \int {\cal D}W_{-} \int {\cal D}\omega_{+}  \; e^{ -H_{\rm f} }
   \int \! {\cal D}{\bf r} \; e^{-U_{\rm id} - H_{\rm c}}
   \quad,
\f]
in which
\f[
   H_{\rm f}  =
   \int \! d{\bf r} \; \left \{
   \frac{W_{-}^{2}({\bf r}) }{v \chi}
   - i \omega_{+}({\bf r}) c_{0}
   + \frac{\chi}{4v} \right \}
\f]
\f[
   H_{\rm c}  = \int \! d{\bf r} \;
   \left [ W_{-}({\bf r}) C_{-}({\bf r})
     + i \omega_{+}({\bf r}) C_{+}({\bf r}) \right ]
   \quad.
\f]
Note that \f$ H_{\rm f} \f$ is an explicit harmonic functional of
auxiliary fields (so that the subscript f denotes "field"), while
\f$ H_{\rm c} \f$ introduces a coupling between auxiliary fields and
the monomer concentrations (so that the subscript c denotes
"concentration" or "coupling").

It is convenient for some purposes to defined a "Wick rotated" 
pressure-like field
\f[
   W_{+}({\bf r}) \equiv i \omega_{+}({\bf r})
\f]
defined such that
\f[
   H_{\rm f}  =
   \int \! d{\bf r} \; \left \{
   \frac{W_{-}^{2}({\bf r}) }{v \chi}
   - W_{+}({\bf r}) c_{0}
   + \frac{\chi}{4v} \right \}
\f]
\f[
   H_{\rm c}  = \int \! d{\bf r} \;
   \left [ W_{-}({\bf r}) C_{-}({\bf r})
     +  W_{+}({\bf r}) C_{+}({\bf r}) \right ]
   \quad.
\f]
Hamiltonian component \f$ H_{\rm c} \f$ can also be expressed in terms
of the original monomer concentrations \f$ c_{1} \f$ and \f$ c_{2} \f$
as a sum
\f[
   H_{\rm c}  =
   \int \! d{\bf r} \;
   \left [ w_{1}({\bf r}) c_{1}({\bf r})
     + w_{2}({\bf r}) c_{2}({\bf r}) \right ]
\f]
in which
\f[
   w_{1}({\bf r}) =  W_{+}({\bf r}) + W_{-}({\bf r}) \;
\f]
\f[
   w_{2}({\bf r}) =  W_{+}({\bf r}) - W_{-}({\bf r}) .
\f]
are complex fields that act on monomers of types \f$ 1 \f$ and
\f$ 2 \f$, respectively.

<b> Field-Theoretic Hamiltonian:  </b>

Integrating over particle positions in the above expression for \f$ Z \f$
yields a factor of \f$ Z_{\rm id}[w] \f$ within the remaining functional
integral over the fields. The resulting expression for \f$ Z \f$ obtained
above can be summarized as a functional integral of the form
\f[
   Z = N^{-1}
   \int {\cal D}W_{-}
   \int {\cal D}\omega_{+} \; e^{-H}
   \quad,
\f]
in which
\f[
   H  = -\ln Z_{\rm id}[w] + H_{\rm f} \quad.
\f]
is a field theoretic Hamiltonian that is a functional of the fields
\f$ W_{-} \f$ and \f$ \omega_{+} \f$, and in which
\f[
   Z_{\rm id}[w]
   = \int \! {\cal D}{\bf r} \; e^{-U_{\rm id} - H_{\rm c}}
\f]
is the partition function for a hypothetical gas of non-interacting
molecules subjected to fluctuating external fields, in which monomers
of type \f$ i \f$ are subjected to a field \f$ w_{i}({\bf r}) \f$, with
\f$ w_1 = i\omega_{+} + W_{-} \f$ and
\f$ w_2 = i\omega_{+} - W_{-} \f$.

The field theoretic Hamiltonian \f$ H \f$ defined above can be expressed
as an analytic functional of the fields \f$ W_{-}({\bf r}) \f$ and
\f$ W_{+}({\bf r}) \f$.  It is straightforward to show that the
functional derivatives of \f$ H[ W_{-}, W_{+}] \f$ with respect to these
fields are given by
\f[
    \quad \left . \frac{\delta H}{\delta W_{-}({\bf r})}
    \right |_{W_{+}} = \frac{1}{v}
    \left [\,
    \phi_{1}({\bf r}) - \phi_{2}({\bf r}) - \frac{2 W_{-}({\bf r})}{\chi}
     \, \right ]
    \quad
\f]
\f[
   \left .  \frac{\delta H}{\delta W_{+}({\bf r}) }
   \right |_{W_{-}}
    = \frac{1}{v}
   \left [ \, \phi_{1}({\bf r}) + \phi_{2}({\bf r}) - 1 \, \right ]
   \quad.
\f]
A saddle-point of the Hamiltonian is defined to be a field configuration
in which functional derivatives with respect to both fields vanish for
all \f$ {\bf r} \f$. It is straightforward to show that the resulting
saddle point equations are equivalent to the self-consistent field
equations used in SCFT for such an AB system, and that the value of the
Hamiltonian at such a saddle point is equal to the SCFT free energy.
Saddle-point field configurations thus correspond to SCFT solutions.

\section psfts_theory_general_sec Field Theory: General Case (\f$ M \geq 2 \f$)

The software implementation of PS-FTS in PSCF is based on a "symmetric" 
formulation of the field theory for incompressible models that is designed 
to allow generalization to systems with \f$ M > 2 \f$. This formulation is 
presented in the following reference:

\anchor psfts_theory_MYC_article
"Polymer Field Theory for Multimonomer Incompressible Systems:
Symmetric Formation and ABC Systems",
D. Morse, D. Yong, K. Chen, <em> Macromolecules </em> <b> 58 </b>, 
816-825 (2025).
<https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.macromol.4c02636>

When this general formulation is applied to a standard AB system, it 
\ref psfts_theory_general_AB_sub "can be shown" to reduce to the formulation 
for AB systems that is described above.  The use of the more general 
symmetric formulation of field theory within the implementation of PSCF 
is intended to facilitate later development of PS-FTS methods for some 
systems with \f$ M > 2 \f$.  The current version of PSCF has, however, 
thus been used and tested primarily with standard AB systems, and some 
algorithms for \f$ M > 2 \f$ remain incomplete. The current status of 
PS-FTS algorithms for systems with \f$ M > 2 \f$ is discussed on the 
\ref psfts_psa_status "following page".

The basic working equations of this symmetric formulation are summarized 
below. This summary is provided primarily as a theory reference for users 
who examine the source code. Further details, including analyses of the 
special cases of AB and ABC systems, are given in the article cited 
above.

<b> Matrix Notation: </b>

Throughout the following discussion, we use bold-faced symbols to denote
column vectors and matrices in which column and row indices are associated
with monomer types. Specifically, let \f$ {\bf c}({\bf r}) \f$ denote the
\f$ M \times 1 \f$ column vector with elements given by the monomer 
concentrations \f$ c_{1}({\bf r}), \ldots, c_{M}({\bf r}) \f$ at position 
\f$ {\bf r} \f$, and let \f$ {\boldsymbol \chi} \f$ denote the symmetric 
\f$ M \times M \f$ matrix of Flory-Huggins interaction parameters.

The incompressibility constraint can be expressed in matrix notation as a 
requirement that
\f[
   {\bf e}^{T} {\bf c}({\bf r}) = c_{0} \quad,
\f]
in which
\f[
  {\bf e} \equiv \left [ \begin{array}{c}
            1 \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 1
            \end{array} \right ]
\f]
is an \f$ M \f$-component column vector with equal element values
\f$ e_{i}=1 \f$ for all \f$ i = 1, \cdots, M \f$. Here \f${\bf e}^{T} \f$
is the corresponding row vector \f$ {\bf e}^{T} = [1 \ldots 1] \f$,
where a superscript \f$ T \f$ is used to denote a matrix transpose. 
Fluctuations of \f$ {\bf c}({\bf r})\f$ within the subspace orthogonal 
to \f$ {\bf e} \f$ thus preserve the incompressibility constraint.

The formulation of field theory for incompressible systems used in PSCF 
is based on a a decomposition of \f$ {\bf c}({\bf r}) \f$ into components 
parallel and orthogonal to \f$ {\bf e} \f$.  Let \f$ {\bf Q} \f$ and 
\f$ {\bf P} \f$ denote the \f$ M \times M \f$ orthogonal projection 
matrices
\f[
   {\bf Q} \equiv \frac{1}{M}{\bf e}{\bf e}^{T}
   \quad\quad, \quad\quad
   {\bf P} \equiv {\bf I} - {\bf Q}
   \quad,
\f]
where \f$ {\bf I} \f$ is the \f$ M \times M \f$ identity matrix.
Note that \f$ {\bf Q}{\bf e} = {\bf e} \f$, \f$ {\bf P}{\bf e} = 0 \f$.
Also note that \f$ {\bf Q} \f$ and \f$ {\bf P} \f$ are both idempotent 
(i.e., that \f$ {\bf Q}{\bf Q} = {\bf Q} \f$, 
\f$ {\bf P}{\bf P} = {\bf P} \f$),
and that \f$ {\bf Q}{\bf P} = {\bf P}{\bf Q} = 0 \f$.
Multiplying any M-component column vector by \f$ {\bf Q} \f$ yields the 
orthogonal projection of the original vector onto \f$ {\bf e} \f$.
Multiplying such a vector by \f$ {\bf P} \f$ instead yields the
projection of the vector into the \f$ M-1 \f$ dimensional subspace
orthogonal to \f$ {\bf e} \f$ .

<b> Projected \f$ \chi \f$ Matrix: </b>

Let \f$ \tilde{\boldsymbol\chi} \f$ denote a symmetric \f$ M \times M \f$
matrix defined by the matrix product
\f[
   \tilde{\boldsymbol \chi}
   \equiv {\bf P}{\boldsymbol \chi}{\bf P} \quad,
   \quad.
\f]
We refer to this as the projected \f$ \chi \f$ matrix.
Let \f$ \tilde{\chi}_{ij} \f$ denote the element in row i and column j 
of the matrix \f$ \tilde{\boldsymbol \chi} \f$ .  Note that
\f$ \tilde{\boldsymbol{\chi}} {\bf e} = 0\f$, implying that 
\f$ \tilde{\boldsymbol{\chi}} \f$ is a singular matrix for which
\f$ {\bf e} \f$ is an eigenvector with a zero eigenvalue.

Let \f$ {\bf v}_{1}, \ldots, {\bf v}_{M} \f$ denote \f$ M \f$ orthogonal
eigenvectors of the symmetric matrix \f$ \tilde{\boldsymbol \chi} \f$,
and let \f$ \lambda_{1}, \ldots, \lambda_{M} \f$ be the corresponding
real eigenvalues,  defined such that
\f[
   \tilde{\boldsymbol\chi} {\bf v}_{\alpha} =
   \lambda_{\alpha} {\bf v}_{\alpha}
\f]
for all \f$ \alpha = 1, \ldots, M \f$ .
As already noted, \f$ {\bf e} \f$ is always an eigenvector with a zero
eigenvalue. By convention, we take this to be the last eigenvector in
the list, so that
\f[
   {\bf v}_{M} = {\bf e}
\f]
and \f$ \lambda_{M}=0 \f$. We choose a normalization convention for 
which
\f[
   {\bf v}_{\alpha}^{T} {\bf v}_{\beta}
   = \delta_{\alpha\beta}M
\f]
for all \f$ \alpha, \beta = 1,\ldots, M \f$ .
This convention is chosen to be compatible with the norm of
\f$ {\bf e} = {\bf v}_{M} \f$, for which \f$ {\bf e}^{T}{\bf e} = M \f$.
Because eigenvectors of a real symmetric matrix with distinct eigenvalues
must be orthogonal, the \f$ M - 1 \f$ eigenvectors
\f$ {\bf v}_{1}, \ldots, {\bf v}_{M-1} \f$ with generally nonzero
eigenvalues are all orthogonal to \f$ {\bf e} \f$, and thus span the
\f$ M - 1 \f$ dimensional subspace orthogonal to \f$ {\bf e} \f$ .

Let \f$ C_{\alpha}({\bf r}) \f$ denote a component of the vector
\f$ {\bf c}({\bf r}) \f$ in a basis of these eigenvectors, defined such
that
\f[
   {\bf c}({\bf r}) = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{\alpha = 1}^{M}
   C_{\alpha}({\bf r}) {\bf v}_{\alpha}
   \quad\quad
   C_{\alpha}({\bf r}) =
   {\bf v}^{T}_{\alpha} {\bf c}({\bf r})
\f]
for all \f$ \alpha = 1, \ldots, M \f$ .
Here and hereafter, we use lower case Greek letters \f$ \alpha, \beta \f$
for eigenvector indices and small Latin letters \f$ i, j, \ldots \f$ for
monomer type indices, and use the Einstein summation convention and/or
matrix multiplication only to represent sums over repeated monomer type
indices.  Note that, because \f$ {\bf v}_{M} = {\bf e} \f$, the constraint
requires that \f$ C_{M}({\bf r}) = c_{0}\f$ for all \f$ {\bf r} \f$.

By substituting the expansion of \f$ {\bf c} \f$ in eigenvectors of the
projected \f$ \chi \f$ matrix into the definition of \f$ U_{\rm int} \f$,
while setting \f$ C_{M}({\bf r}) = c_{0} \f$ and noting that
\f$ {\bf P}{\bf v}_{\alpha} = {\bf v}_{\alpha} \f$ for all
\f$ \alpha = 1, \ldots, M - 1 \f$, it is straightforward to show that
\f[
   U_{\rm int} =
   \sum_{\alpha=1}^{M-1}
   \int d{\bf r} \;  \left \{
   \frac{v \lambda_{\alpha} }{2M} C_{\alpha}^{2} ({\bf r})
   + S_{\alpha} C_{\alpha}({\bf r})
   \right \}
   + U_{\rm int}^{(0)} 
\f]
where we have defined
\f[
   S_{\alpha} \equiv
   \frac{1}{M^2} {\bf v}_{\alpha}^{T} {\boldsymbol \chi} {\bf e}
\f]
for all \f$ \alpha = 1, \ldots, M \f$, 
\f[
    U_{\rm int}^{(0)} = VS_{M}/2v 
\f]
and \f$ V \f$ is total system volume.

Field components associated with positive and negative eigenvalues 
of \f$ \tilde{\boldsymbol \chi} \f$ must be treated differently when 
constructing a functional integral representation of \f$ Z \f$ .
For each \f$ \alpha = 1, \ldots, M - 1\f$, let
\f[
   \lambda_{\alpha}  = - \sigma_{\alpha}^{2} |\lambda_{\alpha}|
   \quad,
\f]
with \f$ \sigma_{\alpha} = 1 \f$ for all \f$ \lambda_{\alpha} < 0 \f$
and \f$ \sigma_{\alpha} = i \f$ for \f$ \lambda_{\alpha} > 0 \f$.
By convention, we also define \f$ \sigma_{M} = i \f$ .
Let \f$ L \f$ denote the number of negative eigenvalues of
\f$ \tilde{\boldsymbol \chi} \f$ . By convention, for systems with
\f$ 0 < L < M - 1 \f$, we take the first \f$ L \f$ eigenvalues
\f$ \lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_{L} \f$ to be negative and take
eigenvalues \f$ L+1, \ldots, M - 1 \f$ to be non-negative, while
\f$ \lambda_{M} = 0 \f$ .

<b> Particle-Field Transformation: </b>

A Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation may used to transform the
Boltzmann factor \f$ \exp( -U_{\rm int} ) \f$ given above into a 
functional integral over \f$ M - 1 \f$ real-valued auxiliary fields 
\f$ \omega_{1}({\bf r}), \ldots, \omega_{M-1}({\bf r}) \f$, of the
form
\f[
   e^{-U_{\rm int} }
   =  \frac{ e^{-U_{\rm int}^{(0)} }}{N}
   \int {\cal D}\omega'
   \exp \left \{ - \sum_{\alpha=1}^{M-1}
   \int \! d{\bf r} \; \left [
    \frac{ M \omega_{\alpha}^{2}}{ 2 v |\lambda_{\alpha}| }
          + \sigma_{\alpha} \omega_{\alpha} C_{\alpha}
          + S_{\alpha} C_{\alpha}
   \right ] \right \}
   \; ,
\f]
where \f$ \int {\cal D} \omega' \f$ denotes a functional integral over 
the \f$ M-1 \f$ auxiliary fields \f$ \omega_{1}, \ldots, \omega_{M-1} \f$, 
\f[
   N \equiv

   \right \}
\f]
is a constant.

The \f$ \delta \f$-function that constrains the total monomer
concentration may also be expressed as a functional integral
\f[
   \delta(c({\bf r}) - c_{0}) =
   \int {\cal D}\omega_{M} \exp \left \{
   - i \int d{\bf r} \; \omega_{M} [ \; C_{M} - c_{0} \; ]
   \right \}
\f]
in which \f$ \omega_{M}({\bf r}) \f$ is a fluctuating Lagrange
multplier field that imposes the constraint requiring that
\f$ C_{M}({\bf r}) = c_{0} \f$, for all \f$ {\bf r} \f$, and
\f$ \int {\cal D}\omega_{M} \f$ is a functional integral over this field.

Substituting the field-theoretic expressions for \f$ e^{-U_{\rm int}} \f$
and the \f$ \delta \f$-function into the definition of the \f$ Z \f$ for
an incompressible system, we obtain
\f[
   Z = N^{-1}
   \int {\cal D}\omega \; e^{ -H_{\rm f} }
   \int \! {\cal D}{\bf r} \; e^{-U_{\rm id} - H_{\rm c}}
   \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ \int {\cal D}\omega \f$ denotes an integral over all
\f$ M \f$ real fields \f$ \omega_{1}, \ldots, \omega_{M} \f$ (including
the Lagrange multiplier field \f$ \omega_{M} \f$ ), and
\f[
   H_{\rm f}  =
   \int \! d{\bf r} \; \left \{
   - \sum_{\alpha=1}^{M-1}
     \frac{M \omega_{\alpha}^{2} }{ 2 v |\lambda_{\alpha}|}
   - i \omega_{M}c_{0} \right \}  + U_{\rm int}^{(0)} \quad
\f]
\f[
   H_{\rm c}  =
   \sum_{\alpha=1}^{M}
   \int \! d{\bf r} \;
    W_{\alpha} ({\bf r}) C_{\alpha}({\bf r})
   \quad.
\f]
The fields \f$ W_{1}, \ldots, W_{M} \f$ used to define \f$ H_{\rm c} \f$
are given by
\f[
   W_{\alpha}({\bf r}) \equiv
   + \sigma_{\alpha} \omega_{\alpha}({\bf r})
   + S_{\alpha}
\f]
for all \f$ \alpha = 1, \ldots, M - 1 \f$ and
\f[
   W_{M}({\bf r}) \equiv i\omega_{M}({\bf r})
   \quad,
\f]
for \f$ \alpha = M \f$.
Note that Hamiltonian component \f$ H_{\rm f} \f$ depends only on
the auxiliary fields (where the subscript f denotes "field"), while
\f$ H_{\rm c} \f$ introduces a coupling between the auxiliary fields
and monomer concentrations (where the subscript c thus denotes
"concentration" or "coupling").

The energy \f$ H_{\rm c} \f$ can also be expressed as a sum
\f[
   H_{\rm c}  =
   \sum_{i=1}^{M} \int \! d{\bf r} \;
   w_{i}({\bf r})c_{i}({\bf r})
   \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ w_{1}({\bf r}), \ldots w_{M}({\bf r}) \f$ denote
potential fields associated with specific monomer types, given by
\f[
   w_{i}({\bf r}) =
   \sum_{\alpha=1}^{M} W_{\alpha}({\bf r}) v_{\alpha i}
   \quad \quad
   W_{\alpha}({\bf r}) =
   \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^{M} v_{\alpha j} w_{j}({\bf r})
\f]
for all \f$ i = 1, \ldots, M \f$ and \f$ \alpha = 1, \ldots, M \f$ .
The fields \f$ w_{1}, \ldots, w_{M} \f$ are the monomer chemical
potential fields used within the solution of the modified diffusion
equation to compute single-polymer partition functions for chains
in an external field.

<b> Field-Theoretic Hamiltonian:  </b>

The functional integral expression for \f$ Z \f$ obtained above may
expressed as an integral
\f[
  Z = N^{-1} \int {\cal D}\omega \; e^{-H}
\f]
in which
\f[
  H = H_{\rm f} - \ln Z_{\rm id}[w]
\f]
is an effective Hamiltonian, and
\f[
  Z_{\rm id}[w] =
  \int {\cal D}{\bf r} \; e^{-U_{\rm id} - H_{\rm c} } \\
\f]
is the partition function of a hypothetical gas of non-interacting
molecules in which monomers of type \f$ i \f$ are subjected to a
field \f$ w_{i}({\bf r}) \f$ . The result is a straightforward
generalization of that obtained for standard AB systems, after
generalizing the definitions of both \f$ H_{\rm f} \f$ and
\f$ H_{\rm c} \f$.

<em> Comment (for users that read the source code) </em>: Many of the data
structures and algorithms that are required to implement this symmetric 
formulation of polymer field theory, but that are not needed for SCFT, are 
provided by the Simulator class template defined in either the Pscf::Rpc 
and Pscf::Rpg namespaces.  These two closely analogous class templates each 
takes the dimension D of space as a template parameter, and only differ in 
that Pscf::Rpc::Simulator is designed for a CPU, while Pscf::Rpg::Simulator 
is designed to use a GPU.  In either namespace, the Simulator class template
provides code to construct and diagonalize the projected chi matrix, and 
to compute the field theoretic Hamiltonian \f$ H \f$ and its functional 
derivatives. Instances of the Simulator template are used as base classes 
for \ref rpc_BdSimulator_page "BdSimulator" and 
\ref rpc_McSimulator_page "McSimulator" classes that provide more specialized 
algorithms and data structures that are needed for Brownian dynamics (BD) or 
Monte Carlo (MC) samplying algorithms, respectively.

<b> Standard AB Systems (Revisited): </b>

For any system with \f$ M = 2 \f$, the fact that 
\f$ {\bf v}_{M} = {\bf v}_{2} = {\bf e} \f$, and that distinct eigenvectors
of \f$ \tilde{\boldsymbol \chi} \f$ must be orthogonal, immediately implies
that \f$ {\bf v}_{1} = [1 -1]^{T} \f$. For a standard AB system with
\f$ \chi_{11} = \chi_{22} = 0 \f$, it is straightforward to use knowledge
of eigenvector \f$ {\bf v}_{1} \f$ to show that
\f[
    \lambda_1 = -\chi \quad\quad 
    S_{1} = 0  \quad,
\f]
and that \f$ U^{(0)}_{\rm int} = V \chi /(4 v) \f$.
For \f$ \chi > 0 \f$, this yields \f$ \lambda_{1} < 0 \f$ and thus
\f$ \sigma_{1} = 1 \f$. Substituting these values into the general
expressions for \f$ H_{\rm f} \f$ and \f$ H_{\rm c} \f$ is then found to 
reproduce the expressions given previously for a standard AB system.  The 
general symmetric formulation for incompressible systems thus includes 
the above formulation for standard AB systems with \f$ \chi > 0 \f$ as 
a special case.
