The pscf_1d program is designed for problems in which fields depend 
on only a single variable, and uses a a regular one-dimensional mesh 
to discretize the solutions.  This program uses a simple file format 
for w and c fields that contains a header and data section. 

<b>Header</b>: The header provides values for
  
   - nx , the number of number of grid points
   - nm , the number of monomer types.

<b>Data section</b>: Each row in the data section starts with the index of a 
grid point, followed by values of all fields at that grid point.  Each 
column after the first gives the values of the field associated with a 
specific monomer type, listed in order of increasing monomer type index.
The first row (index 0) contains field values at the lower bound of the 
coordinate (xmin), while the last row (index nx-1) contains values at the 
upper bound (xmax). 

\section user_field_r1d_example_sec Example:

An example of a w (chemical potential) file is shown below. A large part 
of the data section has beem omitted, as indicated by vertical dots.

\section user_field_r1d_bc_sec Boundary Conditions:

The pscf_1d program solves the underlying modified diffusion equation
using a boundary condition that requires the 1D spatial derivative of 
the propagator to vanish at both endpoints. 

An additional constraint is applied when a problem is solved in 
canonical ensemble, in which values of volume fraction phi (rather than 
chemical potential mu) are specified for all polymer and solvent species. 
In this case, the value of the chemical potential is taken to zero for 
the last monomer type at the last grid point, by convention. This 
convention is why a value of 0.0000 is shown for the last column of the 
last row in the above example.
