\section user_model_polymer_model_sec Continuous vs discrete chain models

The pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs can treat polymer conformations using
either of two slightly different mathematical models, which we refer to
as the continuous "thread" model and the discrete "bead" model.

<ul>

<li>
The **thread** model idealizes each block of a polymer as a continuous
random walk, with no discrete beads or monomers.
</li>

<li> The **bead** model is instead based on an physical model of each
block of a block polymer as a sequence of discrete point particles, or
"beads", connected by harmonic springs.
</li>

</ul>
The pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs for systems with periodic boundary
conditions can perform either SCFT or PS-FTS calculations, and can use
either the thread or bead model for either type of calculation.  In both
of these programs, the choice of bead or thread model is global - the
same model (bead or thread) must be used for all blocks of all polymer
species in the system.

The pscf_1d program for one-dimensional systems can only use the thread
model, and can only perform SCFT calculations.

Calculations that use the thread model use numerical algorithms to solve
the modified diffusion equation actually do discretize the contour length
of each block into steps of some length \f$ ds \f$. In this model, however,
users input values for block lengths and \f$ ds \f$ separately, and
\f$ ds \f$ is understood to be a purely algorithmic parameter, rather
than a physical parameter.  Numerical algorithms used for the thread
model are designed to converge rapidly to the continuus thread limit as
\f$ ds \f$ is decreased while block lengths and other parameters are
held fixed.  Algorithms used for the bead model are instead designed to
reproduce the properties of this inherently discrete model as accurately
as possible.

We generally recommend the use of the thread model in pscf_pc and
pscf_pg for SCFT calculations, because it provides numerical results
that are more nearly independent of how each block is discretized, thus
reducing the number of parameter required to describe a system and to
interpret the results. Both bead and thread models have been used in
recent work on on PS-FTS calculations. The main advantage of the use
of a bead model in PS-FTS calculations is that it is somewhat less
computationally expensive.

\subsection user_model_polymer_continuous_sub Continuous "thread" model

In the thread model, we imagine that the conformation of a single block
of contour length \f$ L \f$ within a block polymer can be characterized
by a continous path \f$ \textbf{R}(s) \f$ that gives the position
\f$ {\bf R} \f$ of a point along the polymer as a function of a
dimensionless contour coordinate \f$ s \f$, for \f$ s \in [0, L] \f$.

In this model, a chain segment between points with contour coordinates
\f$ s \f$ and \f$ s' \f$ within a block of monomer type \f$ \alpha \f$
in a homogeneous gas of non-interacting polymers is given by
\f[
    \langle |{\bf R}(s) - {\bf R}(s')|^{2} \rangle
    = |s-s'| b_{\alpha}^{2} \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ b_{\alpha} \f$ is a statistical segment length for chain
segments of type \f$ \alpha \f$. Here, \f$ \langle \cdots \rangle \f$
denotes a statistical average over random-walk configurations within a
homogeneous mixture.

In an incompressible mixture, each linear chain segment of contour
length \f$ |s-s'| \f$ is assumed to occupy a volume \f$ V(s,s') \f$ given
by
\f[
    V(s,s') = v|s-s'| \quad,
\f]
where \f$ v \f$ is a monomer volume parameter.
We sometimes refer to the parameter \f$ v \f$ as the monomer reference
volume. In the thread model, however, it is best understood to represent
a steric volume per unit polymer contour length. By convention, PSCF
requires that this monomer volume parameter be the same for all monomer
types.

\subsection user_model_polymer_bead_sub Discrete "bead" model

In the "bead" model, each block of a block polymer is taken to consist of
a sequence of discrete beads connected by harmonic springs. In this model,
the user must specify the integer number of beads in each block of the
polymer.

Suppose the beads in a block containing \f$ N \f$ beads are labelled
sequentially by an integer index \f$ s = 0, \ldots, N-1 \f$. Let
\f$ {\bf R}(s) \f$ denote the position of bead number s.  In this model,
a chain segment connecting beads with indices \f$ s \f$ and \f$ s' \f$
within a block of monomer type \f$ \alpha \f$ within a homogeneous
liquid would exhibit a mean-squared end-to-end length given by
\f[
    \langle |{\bf R}(s) - {\bf R}(s')|^{2} \rangle_{0}
    =  |s-s'| b_{\alpha}^{2} \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ b_{\alpha} \f$ is the statistical segment length for a
bond that connects two monomers of type \f$ \alpha \f$. In this model,
neighboring beads within a block of monomer type \f$ \alpha \f$ are
connected by harmonic springs with a spring constant
\f$ 3 kT / b_{\alpha}^{2} \f$, and \f$ b_{\alpha}^{2} \f$ is the
mean-squared length of each such bond.

In the bead model for an incompressible system, every bead is assumed to
occupy a volume given by the monomer volume parameter \f$ v \f$, which
has the same value for every type of monomer.

\section user_model_polymer_branched_sec Block connectivity

In every PSCF program, each polymer in a mixture may be either a linear
block polymer or an acyclic branched block polymer. Hompolymers are treated
as a special case of a linear block polymer with only one block.  Because
a linear polymer is a special case of an acyclic branched polymer, the
data structures used within the PSCF source code are designed for the
general case of an acyclic branched polymer. Because linear block polymers
are a very common simple case, however, the PSCF parameter file format
allows the user to declare each species to be either linear or branched,
and allows use of a simplified file format to describe linear polymer
species.

\subsection user_polymer_branched_graph_sub Branched polymers 

A branched block polymer is described in PSCF using the language of graph
theory. The connectivity of each polymer is described as a connected
acyclic graph consisting of a set of vertices connected by edges.  Each
"edge" in this graph corresponds to one block of the polymer. Every edge
(or block) terminates at two distinct vertices. Each vertex corresponds
to either a free chain end or a junction at which two or more blocks are
connected.

The number of edges that terminate at a vertex is known as the degree of
that vertex. Each chain end is vertex of degree 1. Each junction in a
linear block polymer is a vertex of degree 2. Each branch point is a
vertex of degree 3 or greater.

A graph is said to be "connected" if there is exists a continuous path
of edges connecting any two vertices in the graph. A connected graph is
"acyclic", or a "tree", if there exists only a single path connecting
any two vertices.  A standard theorem of graph theory states that any
connected acyclic graph with N edges must have exactly N+1 vertices.
For example, a linear block polymer with N blocks contains two chain
ends and N - 1 two-fold junctions, giving N + 1 vertices.  Similarly,
a star with N edges that are connected at a single central junction has
N chain ends and one junction of degree N, again giving N+1 vertices.
As a result of this thereom, we know that any acyclic block polymer with
N blocks has exactly N + 1 vertices.  In the description of polymer
structure used by PSCF, each block in a polymer with N blocks is assigned
a unique block index in the range [0, N-1], while each vertex is assigned
a unique integer vertex index in the range [0, N]. Each block in such a
graph connects a specific pair of vertices.

In general, the structure of a branched polymer may thus specified in
the thread model by giving a list of blocks in order of increasing block
index, and providing the following information about each block:

   - a monomer type index
   - a block length
   - the indices of the two attached vertices

The only difference between the information required in the thread
and bead model is that each block length is given as a real number
in the thread model and as an integer in the bead model.

\subsection user_model_polymer_branched_linear_sub Linear polymers

PSCF allows a user to specify declare explicitly that a polymer species 
is a linear, and can use this information to determine relationships
among block and vertex indices. By convention, block i of a linear
block polymer of N blocks terminates at vertices with indices i and
i+1. This convention allows PSCF to use a simplified format for
information about blocks in a linear block copolymer, in which values
of the indices of the attached vertices do not need to be explicitly
entered by the user.

\subsection user_model_branched_vertex_sub Vertices in the bead model

A complete specificiation of a bead model requires the introduction of 
a convention for the treatment of bonds that are connected to junctions,
i.e., vertices of degree greater than 1.
The bead model used by PSCF treats each vertex of degree f > 1 as a
"phantom" bead that does not interact with any chemical potential field,
like a bead with a monomer type that has vanishing Flory-Huggins 
parameters for interactions with all monomer types. A bond that
connects such a vertex to a terminal (first or last) bead of a block of 
monomers of type i is taken have a statistical segment length, denoted 
by \f$ a_{i} \f$, that satisfies
\f[
   a_{i}^{2} = b_{i}^{2}/2 \quad,
\f]
where \f$ b_{i} \f is the statistical length of a standard bond that 
connects two beads of type \$i \f$.  If we think of each standard bond 
between two beads of type i as corresponding to a contour length s = 1 
of an underlying continuous chain, then a bond that connects the 
terminal bead of an \f$ i \f$ block to a vertex thus corresponds to a 
"half bond" of contour length s = 1/2.  

Consider application of this rule to a junction of degree 2 that connects
two blocks of types A and B within a linear block polymer. A model that
connects the terminal beads of the A and B blocks to a shared phantom 
vertex by two such "half bonds" is equivalent to a model that directly 
connects these two terminal beads with a bond that has an effective 
statistical segment length \f$ b_{AB} \f$ for which
\f[
   b_{AB}^{2} =
   ( b_{A}^{2} + b_{B}^{2} )/2 \quad,
\f]
where \f$ b_{A} \f$ and \f$ b_{B} \f$ are statistical segment lengths 
of standard bonds of type A and B, respectively. In the case of equal 
statistical segment lengths, \f$ b_{A} = b_{B} \f$, this yields a 
connecting bond for which \f$ b_{AB} = b_{A} = b_{B} \f$, thus yielding 
a conformationally homogeneous chain in this simple case.

This convention was chosen primarily for simplicity. Its main virtues are 
that it yields conformationally homogeneous behavior for the the simple
case discussed above, and that it does not require the user to input any 
more information than that required by the thread model.
