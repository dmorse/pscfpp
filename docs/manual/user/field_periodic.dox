The pscf_pcN and pscf_pgN programs are both designed to treat periodic
structures, and use the same set of several field file formats.

\section user_field_periodic_formats_sec File Formats

The pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs can all read and write fields using
following three field file formats:

  - A \ref user_field_basis_page "basis" file format contains the
    components for a representation of each field as a linear
    superposition of symmetry-adapated basis functions, in which
    each basis function is invariant under all of the elements of
    a specified space group.

  - A \ref user_field_rgrid_page "r-grid" file format contains the
    values of fields defined on the nodes of a regular grid.

  - A \ref user_field_kgrid_page "k-grid" file format that contains
    the discrete Fourier transform of fields defined on a regular
    grid.

Each of these file formats for periodic structures contains a header
section that includes a specification of the crystal system and unit
and unit cell parameters for the crystallographic unit cell. The header
for the r-grid and k-grid format also contains a list of the mesh
dimensions, i.e., the number of grid points in each direction of the
mesh that was used by the program that wrote the file.

The dimensions of the mesh used by the program that reads a file in
r-grid or k-grid format (as given in the parameter file) must match
the dimensions of the mesh used by the program that wrote the file
(as declared in the field file header for these formats).

The basis format is instead designed to allow users to change mesh
dimensions: A instance of a program for which a particular list of
mesh dimensions is declared in the parameter file can usually read
and correctly intepret a field file that was created using a basis
designed for a different mesh. (There are still occasional situations
in which this translation fails, which we in the process of fixing).
The basis format can thus usually be used to change resolution by,
for example, using a converged solution obtained with a coarse mesh
as an initial guess for the solution on a refined mesh.

The current C++ version of PSCF can also read the basis and r-grid
file formats used by the older Fortran PSCF program.  The k-grid
format used by the current version is not backwards compatible with
the analogous k-grid format used by the Fortran program.

The names of some command-file commands that instruct pscf_pc and
pscf_pg programs to read or write field files contain the strings
"BASIS", "RGRID", or "KGRID" to indicate the use of a particular
field file format.

\section user_field_periodic_header_sec Header Section

Each of the three field file formats described above contains a
header section followed by a data section. The header section has
an almost identical form in all three file formats, and contains
information about the dimensionality of space, the crystallographic
unit cell, the space group, and the mesh or basis used to represent
the fields.


\subsection user_field_periodic_header_example_sub Example

As an example, here is header section of a r-grid field file for
a double gyroid phase (space group \f$ Ia \overline{3}d \f$ that
was computed using a mesh with 32 grid points along each of three
orthogonal directions:

\endcode

\subsection user_field_periodic_header_description_sub Description

The first line of the header specifies a file format version number
(file format v1.0).

The rest of the header contains parameter values, each of which is given
as a parameter label on one line followed by a value on the next line.
The header of a field file may contain values for the following parameters,
in the following order:

<b> dim </b>:
The value of the parameter dim is number of dimension in which each field is
periodic. For example, dim=1 for a lamellar phase, dim=2 for a hexagonal phase,
and dim=3 for a 3D cubic or orthorhombic crystal. This quantity is also
referred to by the symbol D throughout the source code and in some other parts
of the web documentation.

<b> crystal_system </b>:
The parameter crystal_system is a string identifer for the crystal system,
i.e., the type of Bravais lattice. Allowed values of this string for each
value of dim are listed \ref user_unitcell_page "here".

<b> N_cell_param </b>:
The parameter N_cell_param is a positive integer that gives the number of
real parameters that are required to describe the unit cell for the specified
crystal_system.  This number can range from 1 for 1D lamellar, 2D square
or hexagonal or 3D cubic crystals, 3 from for a 3D orthorhombic crystal,
up to 6 for a 3D triclinic lattice.

<b> cell_param </b>:
The value of cell_param is a list of N_cell_param real numbers required
to describe the unit cell, separated by spaces. These parameters generally
specify lengths of Bravais basis vectors or unit cell edges and (when
required) angles between those vectors.  The number, order, and the
meaning of those parameters depends upon the value of the crystal_system
identifier, as discussed \ref user_unitcell_page "here".

<b> group_name </b>:
The parameter group_name is a string identifier for a crystallographic
space group.  Allowed values of this identifier string for each
combination of values for dim and crystal_system are listed
\ref user_groups_page "here". The group_name parameter is a required
part of the header for a file basis format, but is an optional element 
for files written in r-grid or k-grid formats.

<b> N_monomer </b>:
The parameter N_monomer is a positive integers that gives the number of 
distinct monomer types for which fields are reported.

<b> N_basis </b>:
The parameter N_basis is a positive integer that gives the number of
basis functions used in a Fourier-adapted Fourier series representation
of the fields. A label "N_star" will also be accepted as a synonym for
"N_basis", to preserve backwards compatability with the label used by
the older PSCF fortran program.
This parameter only appears in the basis file format.

<b> mesh </b>:
The mesh parameter is a list of dim positive integers that give the
mesh dimensions used for numerical calculations, i.e., the number of
grid points in each direction in the mesh that covers a single unit
cell.  A label "ngrid" will also be accepted as a synonym for "mesh",
to allow backwards compatibility with the label used by the PSCF
Fortran program.  This list of values appears as the last parameter 
of the header for r-grid and k-grid file formats, but does not appear 
in the basis format.

All of the above parameters except space_group, mesh and N_basis are 
required elements of the header in all three file formats.
