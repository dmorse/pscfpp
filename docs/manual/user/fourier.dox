This page describes the different numerical representations used in the 
pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs to describe fields (functions of position) 
that have the periodicity of a Bravais lattice. In a 
\ref user_basis_page "subsequent appendix", we also consider a type of
symmetry-adapted Fourier expansion appropriate for periodic fields that 
are known to be invariant under all symmetry operations of a specified 
space group.  

Below, we give succinct descriptions of Bravais lattices and reciprocal
lattices, emphasizing aspects that are relevant to the PSCF software.
We also briefly review the use of Fourier series for continuous periodic 
fields, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of periodic fields that are 
defined on the nodes of a mesh, and the notion of wavevector aliasing.
Readers who have not previously encountered some of these topics may 
find it useful to also consult more detailed treatments. For a general 
overview of topics related to periodic structures and crystal symmetry, 
we recommend the book *Structure of Materials: An Introduction to 
Crystallography, Diffraction and Symmetry* by Marc De Graef and Michael 
E. McHenry.  For a discussion of Fourier methods and a summary of the 
numerical benefits of solving differential equations in reciprocal space 
(sometimes called "spectral accuracy"), we recommend the first four 
chapters of the book *Spectral Methods in MATLAB* by Lloyd N. Trefethen.

Throughout these notes, let \f$ D \f$ denote the number of directions 
in which the fields of interest are taken to be periodic, which is the 
dimensionality of the space in which these fields are defined. Allowed 
values of \f$ D \f$ are \f$ D = 1 \f$ for lamellar structures, \f$ D = 
2 \f$ for structures such as those involving two-dimensionally periodic 
arrangements of cylinders (e.g., hexagonally packed cylinders), and 
\f$ D = 3 \f$ for crystals with full three-dimensional periodicity (e.g.,
arrangements of spheres and 3D network structures).

\section user_fourier_bravais_sec Bravais lattice

Consider a D-dimensional crystal with a Bravais lattice defined by
lattice basis vectors \f$ {\bf a}_{0}, \ldots, {\bf a}_{D-1} \f$.
The Bravais lattice is defined to be the infinite set containing
every vector \f$ {\bf R} \f$ that can be expressed as a sum
\f[
   {\bf R} = \sum_{\alpha=0}^{D-1} m_{\alpha} {\bf a}_{\alpha}
\f]
with arbitrary integer values of the indices \f$ m_{0},\ldots,m_{D-1} \f$.
A function \f$ f({\bf r}) \f$ of position \f$ {\bf r} \f$ is said 
to have the periodicity of this lattice if it is  invariant under 
translation by any Bravais lattice vector, i.e., if
\f[
  f({\bf r} + {\bf R}) = f({\bf r})
\f]
for any D-dimensional position vector \f$ {\bf r} \f$ and any translation 
vector \f$ {\bf R} \f$ that belongs to the Bravais lattice.

\section user_fourier_reciprocal_sec Reciprocal lattice

Let \f$ {\bf b}_{0}, \ldots, {\bf b}_{D-1} \f$ denote \f$ D \f$ 
reciprocal lattice basis vectors that are defined such that
\anchor user_fourier_biorthogonality_eqn
\f[
  {\bf a}_{\alpha} \cdot {\bf b}_{\beta} = 2\pi \delta_{\alpha \beta}
\f]
for \f$ \alpha, \beta \in [0,..,D-1] \f$, where \f$ \delta_{\alpha \beta}\f$
is a Kronecker delta function. The reciprocal lattice associated with 
a Bravais lattice is defined to be the infinite set containing every 
wavevector \f$ {\bf G} \f$ that can be expressed as a sum
\anchor user_fourier_Gofn_eqn
\f[
   {\bf G}(n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1})
   = \sum_{\alpha=0}^{D-1} n_{\alpha} {\bf b}_{\alpha}
\f]
with integer values of \f$ n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1} \f$.  In what follows,
we will sometimes refer to the integer indices \f$ n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1}\f$
that appear in this expansion of a reciprocal lattice vector as Miller
indices for that wavevector.

Any continuous function \f$ f({\bf r}) \f$ of position \f$ {\bf r} \f$ with 
the periodicity of a Bravais lattice may be expanded as a Fourier series 
\anchor user_fourier_fourierR_eqn
\f[
  f({\bf r}) = \sum_{{\bf G}} \tilde{f}({\bf G})
  e^{i {\bf G} \cdot {\bf r}}
  \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ {\bf G} \f$ denotes a reciprocal lattice vector, the sum 
is taken over the infinite set of all reciprocal lattice vectors, and 
\f$ \tilde{f}({\bf G}) \f$ is a complex Fourier coefficient associated
with wavevector \f$ {\bf G} \f$.  The Fourier coefficient 
\f$ \tilde{f}({\bf G}) \f$ is equal to the value of the integral
\f[
  \tilde{f}({\bf G}) =  \frac{1}{V_{\rm cell}}
  \int\limits_{{\rm cell}} d^{D}r \;
  e^{-i {\bf G} \cdot {\bf r}} f({\bf r}) \quad,
\f]
in which the integral is a D-dimensional integral over one unit cell,
and \f$ V_{\rm cell} \f$ is the generalized volume of the unit cell 
(i.e., the unit cell length for D=1, area for D=2, or volume for D=3).

The type of Fourier series defined above can be used to expand either 
real- or complex-valued periodic functions of position. If \f$ f \f$ is 
a real-valued function, then its Fourier coefficients must satisfy the 
condition
\f[
   \tilde{f}(-{\bf G}) = \tilde{f}^{*}({\bf G})
\f]
for any reciprocal lattice vector \f$ {\bf G} \f$. Here and hereafter,
we use \f$ C^{*} \f$ to denote the complex conjugate of any complex
number \f$ C \f$.  Note that this constraint requires that that
\f$ \tilde{f}({\bf G}) \f$ be real in the specal case
\f$ {\bf G} = 0 \f$.

\section user_fourier_reduced_sec Reduced coordinates

It is convenient to introduce dimensionless reduced coordinates
\f$ r_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1} \f$ associated with any Cartesian position
vector \f$ {\bf r} \f$ within a crystal, which are defined such that
\f[
   {\bf r}(r_0, \ldots, r_{D-1})
   = \sum_{\alpha = 0}^{D-1} {\bf a}_{\alpha} r_{\alpha}
  \quad.
\f]
The reduced coordinates are thus the components of \f$ {\bf r} \f$
in a basis of Bravais lattice basis vectors.
The primary unit cell of a crystal is defined to be a region in
which \f$ 0 \leq r_{\alpha} < 1 \f$ for all \f$ \alpha = 0, \ldots, D-1 \f$.
This corresponds to a unit domain in the space of reduced coordinates that
is give by the domain \f$ [0,1) \f$ for D=1, a unit square for D=2 or a
unit cube for D=3.  This maps onto a unit cell in Cartesian coordinates
that is a parallelogram for D=2 or a parallelepiped for D=3, and for
which the vectors connecting neighboring corners are Bravais lattice
basis vectors.

Suppose that \f$ f({\bf r}) \f$ is a periodic function of the
Cartesian position vector \f$ {\bf r} \f$ and that
\f$ F(r_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1}) \f$ is an equivalent function of
the reduced coordinates \f$ r_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1} \f$, defined
such that
\f[
 F(r_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1}) =
 f({\bf r}(r_{0},\ldots,r_{D-1}))
\f]
for any list of reduced coordinates.
The requirement that a function \f$ f({\bf r})\f$ be periodic under
translations by Bravais lattice vector is equivalent to a requirement
that \f$ F \f$ be invariant under changes of any reduced coordinate
by addition of arbitrary integer.  That is, for any periodic function
\f$ F \f$ of the reduced coordinates,
\f[
   F(r_{0} + k_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1} + k_{D-1} )
   = F(r_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1} )
\f]
for arbitrary integer values of \f$ k_{0}, \ldots, k_{D-1} \f$.

Using the above expressions for \f$ {\bf r}(r_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1}) \f$ and
\f$ {\bf G}(n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1}) \f$ and the 
\ref user_fourier_biorthogonality_eqn "bi-orthogonality relation"
for Bravais and reciprocal basis vectors, it is straightforward to show
that
\f[
   \exp \left (  i{\bf G} \cdot {\bf r} \right )
   =
   \exp \left ( 2\pi i \sum_{\alpha = 0}^{D-1} n_{\alpha} r_{\alpha} \right )
\f]
for any choice of reciprocal lattice vector \f$ {\bf G}(n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1}) \f$
and any position vector \f$ {\bf r}(r_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1}) \f$.
Upon substituting this into the general Fourier series expansion for
a periodic function \f$ f({\bf r})\f$ given
\ref user_fourier_fourierR_eqn "above", we find that the corresponding
function \f$ F(r_{1}, \ldots, r_{D-1}) \f$ of the reduced coordinates may
be expressed as an infinite series
\anchor user_fourier_fourierX_eqn
\f[
  F(r_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1}) =
  \sum_{n_{0} = -\infty}^{\infty} \cdots
  \sum_{n_{D-1} = -\infty}^{\infty}
  \tilde{F}(n_{0},\ldots,n_{D-1})
  \exp \left ( 2\pi i \sum_{\alpha = 0}^{D-1} n_{\alpha} r_{\alpha} \right )
\f]
in which the sum is taken over all integer values of each of the Miller
indices, and in which
\f$ \tilde{F}(n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1}) \f$ is a Fourier amplitude defined
such that
\f[
   \tilde{f}({\bf G}(n_{0},\ldots,n_{D-1})) \equiv
   \tilde{F}(n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1})
\f]
for the wavevector \f$ {\bf G}(n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1}) \f$ with integer
components \f$n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1}\f$.
This form of the Fourier series is also a special case of the general 
Fourier expansion of a periodic function, as applied here to a function 
\f$ F(r_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1}) \f$ that has the periodicity of a generalized 
cubic lattice with orthogonal Bravais lattice basis vectors of unit 
magnitude.

\section user_fourier_grid_sec Mesh discretization

All periodic fields in are represented internally in pscf_pc and pscf_pg 
using values of fields on a regular D-dimensional mesh in the space of 
the reduced coordinates \f$ r_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1} \f$.
Let \f$ M_{\alpha} \f$ denote the number of mesh points per unit cell
along direction \f$ \alpha \f$ for each integer direction index
\f$ \alpha = 0, \ldots, D-1 \f$.
The values of \f$ M_{0}, \ldots, M_{D-1} \f$ are specified in the
parameter file for pscf_pc or pscf_pg as values for elements of the 
parameter "mesh", whose value is a vector with integer-valued
elements.  Nodes on this mesh correspond to points at which each reduced
coordinate \f$ r_{\alpha} \f$ with \f$ \alpha \in [0, \ldots, D-1]\f$
has a value 
\f[
    r_{\alpha} = m_{\alpha}/M_{\alpha}
\f]
for some integer \f$ m_{\alpha} \in [0,\ldots,M_{\alpha}-1] \f$ for
nodes within the primary unit cell.

\section user_fourier_dft_sec Discrete fourier transform (DFT)

Let \f$ F \f$ denote a function that is defined only on the nodes of such
a regular mesh, where \f$ F(m_{0}, \ldots, m_{D-1}) \f$ denotes the value 
of \f$ F \f$ on the mesh node with integer indices
\f$ m_{0}, \ldots, m_{D-1} \f$.

\subsection user_fourier_dft_forward_sub Forward DFT
Let \f$ \tilde{F} \f$ denote the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of
\f$ F \f$, which we define here by a sum
\anchor user_fourier_dftdef_eqn
\f[
  \tilde{F} (n_0, \ldots, n_{D-1}) =
  \frac{1}{M_{\rm tot}}
  \sum_{m_{0}=0}^{M_{0}-1} \cdots
  \sum_{m_{D-1}=0}^{M_{D-1}-1}
  F(m_{0},\ldots,m_{D-1})
  \exp \left (
  -2\pi i \sum_{\alpha = 0}^{D-1} n_{\alpha} m_{\alpha}/M_{\alpha}
  \right )
\f]
in which \f$ M_{\rm tot} \f$ denotes the total number of mesh points
in the primary unit cell of the mesh, given by the product
\f[
   M_{\rm tot} = M_{0} \cdots M_{D-1} \quad.
\f]
of the numbers of mesh points in each direction.

\subsection user_fourier_dft_inverse_sub Inverse DFT

A periodic function \f$ F \f$ that is defined on the nodes of mesh can
can be expanded in terms of its DFT \f$ \tilde{F} \f$ by applying an
inverse discrete Fourier transform
\anchor user_fourier_dftinverse_eqn
\f[
  F(m_0, \ldots, m_{D-1}) =
  \sum_{n_{0}=0}^{M_{0}-1} \cdots
  \sum_{n_{D-1}=0}^{M_{D-1}-1}
  \tilde{F}(n_{0},\ldots,n_{D-1})
  \exp \left (
  2\pi i \sum_{\alpha = 0}^{D-1} n_{\alpha} m_{\alpha}/M_{\alpha}
  \right )
\f]
Here, as elsewhere in this discussion \f$ F(m_0, \ldots, m_{D-1}) \f$
denotes the value of the function \f$ F \f$ at the mesh point with
integer mesh indices \f$ m_{0}, \ldots, m_{D-1} \f$.  Note that the
sums over the indices \f$ n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1} \f$ in an inverse
discrete DFT extend only over a finite number of values
\f$ n_{\alpha} = 0, \ldots, M_{\alpha}-1 \f$ for each index, giving
a finite rather than an infinite sum.

<em> Relationship to source code: </em>  The D-dimensional forward and
inverse DFT, defined using the conventions given above, are implemented for
the field container classes used by pscf_pc by the member functions
forwardTransform and inverseTransform defined in the class Pscf::Rpc::FFT<D>,
respectively. The class Pscf::Rpc::FFT<D> is an instantiation of the class
template Pscf::Rpc::FFT , in which D=1, 2, or 3 is a template parameter 
that represents the dimensionality of space.  These member functions are 
simple wrappers around functions provided by the open source FFTW package.

Equivalent operations are implemented for the field container classes used
by pscf_pg by corresponding member functions of the class template 
Pscf::Rpg::FFT that are wrappers around functions provided by the 
cuFFT CUDA library, which implements FFTs on a GPU.

\subsection user_fourier_dft_alias_sub Wavevector Aliasing

The discrete Fourier transform \f$ \tilde{F} (n_0, \ldots, n_{D-1}) \f$ is
a function of \f$ D \f$ integer indices, and is thus itself defined on a
lattice in reciprocal space.  It is straightforward to show that the DFT
\f$ \tilde{F} \f$ defined above is itself a periodic function in reciprocal
space, for which \f$ \tilde{F}(n_0, \ldots, n_{D-1}) \f$ is invariant 
under a shift of the index \f$ n_{\alpha} \f$ associated with direction 
\f$ \alpha \f$ by any multiple of the number of mesh points 
\f$ M_{\alpha} \f$ along direction \f$ \alpha \f$. That is, for any 
DFT \f$ \tilde{F} \f$, we have
\f[
  \tilde{F}(n_{0} + k_{0}M_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1} + k_{D-1}M_{D-1}
  = \tilde{F}(n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1})
\f]
for any choice of integers \f$ k_{0}, \ldots, k_{D=1} \f$.

<em> Proof </em>: To prove this statement, we simply note that 
the effect of changing \f$ n_{\alpha}\f$ to 
\f$ n_{\alpha} + k_{\alpha} M_{\alpha} \f$ within the
\ref user_fourier_dftdef_eqn "sum" that defines \f$ \tilde{f} \f$ is
to shift the argument of the exponential by a corresponding integer
multiple \f$ m_{\alpha}k_{\alpha}2\pi i \f$ of \f$ 2\pi i \f$, and
that changing the argument of an exponential by an integer multiple
of \f$ 2\pi i \f$ leaves the value of the exponential unchanged.

This periodicity of the value of any discrete Fourier transforms is 
sometimes referred to as "aliasing" of wavevectors. Any list of D Miller
integer indices \f$ n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1} \f$ can be used to construct 
an associated reciprocal lattice wavevector 
\f$ {\bf G}(n_0, \ldots, n_{D-1}) \f$ in which the Miller indices are 
components of the vector in a basis of reciprocal lattice basis vectors, 
as \ref user_fourier_Gofn_eqn "above".  Two  lists of integer Miller 
indices are referred to as "aliases" of one another if these lists 
contain values for each index \f$ n_{i} \f$ that are either equal or 
that differ by some nonzero integer multiple of the number \f$ M_{i} \f$ 
of mesh points along direction \f$ i \f$, 
for each \f$ i = 0, \ldots , D-1 \f$ .
Reciprocal lattice wavevectors for which the Miller indices are aliases 
are also said to be aliases of one another.

Reciprocal lattice vectors that are aliases of one another yield values
for the complex exponential \f$ \exp( i {\bf G}\cdots {\bf r} ) \f$ that
are equal for any position vector \f$ {\bf r} \f$ that is a node of the
relevant mesh, but that are generally unequal if evaluated for values 
of \f$ {\bf r} \f$ that do not lie on this mesh.  Wavevectors that are 
aliases of one another are thus treated as equivalent within forward and 
inverse DFT operations, in which values of the underlying field are 
only defined on the nodes of a mesh.

\section user_fourier_kindex_sec Wavevector indexing schemes

The phenomena of aliasing of wavevectors for fields that are defined on
a mesh means that there are infinite number of ways of defining Miller
indices so as to generate aliases of a particular wavevector, by adding
or subtracting integer multiples of the number of mesh points to each
index.  Two different conventions are used in PSCF assign a unique list
of indices to each wavevector within a DFT. We refer to the resulting
conventions for lists of indices here as (1) discrete Fourier transform
or DFT indices and (2) Minimal indices.

\subsection user_fourier_dftindex_sub Standard or DFT Indices
The DFT indices of a wavevector are defined such that the index
\f$ n_{i} \f$ associated with reduced coordinate \f$ i \f$ is required
to be in the range \f$ 0, \ldots, N_{i} - 1 \f$, where \f$ N_{i} \f$ is
the number of mesh points in direction \f$ i \f$. This is the indexing
scheme used in the above definitions of the forward and inverse DFT
operations.

\subsection user_fourier_minindex_sub Minimal or Brillouin Zone (BZ) Indices
The minimal indices of a wavevector are indices that are chosen so as 
to give a corresponding Cartesian wavevector
\f$ {\bf G}(n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1}) \f$ as defined
\ref user_fourier_Gofn_eqn "above" as an expansion in reciprocal lattice
basis vectors for which the magnitude  \f$ |{\bf G}| \f$ is minimal.
The indices obtained using this convention are referred to in parts
of the PSCF source code as "Brillouin zone" indices because the
underlying geometrical construction is analogous to that used to
define the first Brillouin zone for crystal wavevectors in band
theories of electronic states in crystalline solids.

If two or more equivalent choices of indices for a wavevector yield
wavevector aliases for which \f$ |{\bf G}| \f$ is equal to its minimum
possible value, then the minimal indices are defined to be the choice
which for which the indices are "maximum" when lists of indices are
compared while giving priority to indices that appear earlier in a
list \f$ (n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1}) \f$, thus ordering first by
\f$ n_{0} \f$, then ordering choices with equal values of \f$ n_{0} \f$
in order of increasing \f$ n_{1} \f$, etc.

<em> Relationship to source code: </em>  The standard (or DFT) and
minimal (or Brillouin zone) indexes of each wavevector used in a
DFT are assigned to each wavevector within the Pscf::Basis<D> class.
