The pscf_pc and pscf_gp programs for periodic systems can also read 
and write files in format that gives the unsymmetrized discrete
Fourier transform of the field associated with each monomer type.
The required file format is very similar to that used for the 
coordinate space grid. The file consists of a header and a data 
section. The format of the header is identical to that used for 
the coordinate grid format, and includes a list of the number of 
grid points used in each direction, denoted by mesh.

The data section contains the Fourier coefficients obtained by a 
discrete Fourier transform of each field at wavevectors given by
\f[
    \textbf{k}(n_1, \ldots, n_{D}) = \sum_{i=0}^{\textrm{D}-1}
    n_{i}\textbf{b}_{i}
\f]
where \f$D\f$ is the dimensionality of the crystal (i.e., dim
in the header file), \f$\textbf{b}_{i}\f$ is a reciprocal lattice 
basis vector, \f$N_{i}\f$ is the number of grid points along 
direction \f$i\f$, and \f$n_{i}\f$ is an integer in the range 
\f$0 \leq n_{D-1} \leq N_{1}/2\f$ for the last index and 
\f$0 \leq n_{i} \leq N_{i} - 1\f$ for indices \f$i < D-1\f$. 
The number of rows in the data section is equal to the total 
number of such wavevectors, and each row contains values of 
Fourier coefficients associated with a single wavevector, with 
coefficients for fields associated with different monomer types 
in different columnns. 

Coefficients for different wavevectors are output in sequential
order, using the last index (e.g., \f$n_{2}\f$ for a 3D crystal) 
as the most rapidly varying (inner-most) loop index. Reading or
writing of the data section for a 3D field performed by a loop 
of the form:
\code
   for (n0 = 0; n0 < N0; ++n0) {
      for (n1 = 0; n1 < N1: ++n1) {
         for (n2 = 0; n2 < N2/2; ++n2) {
            [Read or write coefficients for wavevector k(n0, n1, n2)]
         }
      }
   }
\endcode
where N0, N1, N2 are the number of grid points in directions 
0, ..., 2. 

**Note**: The format of the data section of a k-grid file, as
described above, is different from the format used in the older
Fortran version of PSCF. In the Fortran version, the number of 
gridpoints is halved in the first index (`n0` in the code above)
rather than the last index, as is the case here. The two programs
thus use incompatiable formats for k-grid field files.
