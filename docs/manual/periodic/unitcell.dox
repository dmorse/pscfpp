The input files for pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs use a shared set of
conventions to describe crystallographic unit cells (i.e,. Bravais
lattices).

\section prdc_unitcell_description_sec Unit cell descriptors

Three different types of information are required to completely describe
a crystal lattice, as discussed below:

<em> Spatial dimension </em>: The spatial dimension of a lattice, denoted
   here by D, is a positive integer that gives the number coordinates along
   which the structure is periodic, e.g., D=1 for a lamellar phase,
   D=2 for hexagonally packed cylinders, or D=3 for a three dimensional
   crystal such a BCC lattice or a gyroid network.

<em> Lattice system identifier </em>: The lattice system identifier is a
   string that names one of the allowed crystallographic lattice systems
   (e.g., cubic, orthorhombic, etc) for a crystal of the specified
   dimensionality.  The set of allowed values of this string identifier
   is different for 1, 2, and 3 dimensional crystals, as discussed below.

<em> Lattice parameters </em>: Values of the lattice parameters specify
   the size and shape of the unit cell by specifying values for the
   lengths lengths of the Bravais lattice basis vectors (corresponding
   to the lengths of edges of the unit cell) and, when necessary, values
   of angles between such vectors.

The number of parameters required to describe a unit cell is different
for different lattice systems.  For example, a 3D cubic lattice can be
specified by giving a single parameter, which is the length of any of
the three orthogonal basis vectors, whereas 6 parameters (3 lengths and
three angles) are required to describe a 3D triclinic lattice.  By
convention, the required lattice parameters for each lattice system
type are always listed in a specific order that is described below 
for each of the possible 1, 2 and 3 dimensional lattice systems.

These three different types of information are provided to a pscf_pc or
pscf_pg program in different ways:

<em> Spatial dimension </em>: The PSCF package requires the user to 
specify the spatial dimension D of a periodic structure that will be
treated by the pscf_pc or pscf_pg program as an argument of the -d 
command line option for those programs. 

<em> Lattice system identifier </em> : The string identifier for a 
lattice system is a required parameter in the parameter file format for 
all pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs. This identifier is given as the value 
of the parameter with the label "lattice" within the Domain block of the 
parameter file.  The choice of lattice system that is specified in the 
parameter file cannot be changed during later stages of program execution. 
To perform calculations involving several different lattice systems, one 
must instead execute the relevant program or programs several times with 
different input parameter files.

<em> Lattice parameters </em>: Values for the lattice parameters
(i.e., lengths of the edges of the unit cell and angles between them) do
not appear in the parameter file, but are instead usually provided within
an input field file that is read by the program. All of the field file
formats used by pscf_pc and pscf_pg contain a file header that contains
lattice system identifier and a list of values for lattice parameters. 
The lattice system identifier in the header of any field file read by 
the program must agree with that declared in the parameter file - the 
program will halt execution with an error message if they do not. Users 
can also explicitly set or modify lattice parameter values by executing 
the SET_LATTICE_PARAMETERS command, which takes the lattice parameter 
values as a list of command arguments.

Allowed values of the lattice system identifier and conventions for the
meaning and conventional order of required unit cell parameters for
each lattice system type are described below for 1, 2 and 3 dimensional
systems.

\section prdc_unitcell_1D_sec 1D systems

There is only possible lattice system for a one dimensionally periodic
system, which is identifed by the string "lamellar". A 1D lamellar
system only has one lattice parameter, which is the repeat distance
along the direction in which the system is periodic, denoted here by
d.

This information is repeated below in tabular format analogous to that
used for 2D and 3D systems. In this format, the "lattice system" column
gives the allowed values (or value) for the lattice system identifier
string, N is the number of required input parameters for each lattice
system, "parameters" gives the name(s) of all required parameters in the
order in which they must be listed in any input file, and "description"
describes the meaning of those parameters.

\section prdc_unitcell_2D_sec 2D systems

There are 4 conventional 2D lattice systems (square, hexagonal,
rectangular, and oblique). The code also allows the user to specify
a "rhombic" unit cell, which is an oblique unit cell in which the two
basis vectors have equal magnitude.

The names of the lattice systems, and the list of parameter required by
each is listed below. Throughout, let a and b denote the lengths of the
lattice basis vectors, and let alpha denote the angle between these two
vectors. When a value for the parameter alpha is required, it must be
provided in radians, and not in degrees.

\section prdc_unitcell_3D_sec 3D systems

In what follows we use the letters a, b, c both to denote lengths of the
three Bravais lattice basis vectors and as labels to identify the actual
vectors.  Different definitions of angles are used for different lattice
systems, as discussed below:
