An external matlab package named 
<a href="https://github.com/kdorfmanUMN/polymer_visual">Polymer Visual</a>
has been created to allow visualization of periodic microstructures created
by PSCF calculations.  Specifically, this package was designed to allow users 
of PSCF to generate figures that characterize the kinds of periodic structures 
predicted by using pscf_pc or pscf_pg to perform SCFT calculations. 

The Polymer Visual can read files containing the monomer concentration fields 
written in the \ref scft_field_rgrid_page "r-grid" field file format used by 
pscf_pc and pscf_pg, and can generate several different types of color plots. 
Among the possible outputs are plots that show monomer volume fractions along 
one- and two-dimensional cuts through a structure, and three-dimensional 
perspective plots that show isosurfaces of monomer concentration fields.

Polymer Visual is written as a package of MATLAB functions. It may either be 
cloned or downloaded as a zip file from the github repository 

 - <a href="https://github.com/kdorfmanUMN/polymer_visual"> github.com/kdorfmanUMN/polymer_visual </a>

The main web page of that repository provides a complete user manual, which 
includes examples of the different types of plots that can be generated.
