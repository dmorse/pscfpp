Features of PSCF programs are listed below, grouped so as to indicate
the programs and computational methods to which they apply:

* **Features for both SCFT and FTS (all programs):**

  - Ability to treat mixtures containing any number of block polymer,
    homopolymer, and solvent molecular species. 

  - Ability to treat acyclic branched block polymers, as well as linear
    block polymers

  - Ability to use canonical, grand-canonical or mixed statistical
    ensembles. 

  - Thorough user and developer documentation provided via an integrated
    web manual

  - Well documented source code written in object-oriented C++

  - A library of example input files for many types of calculation

  - Python tools for data analysis and file processing

* **Features for SCFT (all programs):**

  - Efficient Anderson-mixing SCFT iteration algorithms

  - Efficient SCFT calculations for sequences of parameter choices along
    a path in parameter space ("sweeps"), using extrapolation to construct
    initial guesses

All features listed below are specific to the pscf_pc and pscf_pg 
programs. Both of these programs are designed for systems with periodic
boundary conditions and provide very similar features. Both can be used 
perform either SCFT or PS-FTS calculations. In SCFT, the periodic 
computational unit cell is usually chosen so as to represent a single 
crystallographic unit cell, whereas in FTS it may represent a larger
region. 

* **Features for SCFT or PS-FTS on periodic systems (pscf_pc and pscf_pg):**

  - Choice of continuous thread or discrete bead models of polymer
    chains conformations.

  - Accurate pseudo-spectral solution of the modified diffusion equation
    for a continuous chain using an algorithm that is accurate to 4th 
    order in the contour length step size.

  - Periodic unit cells with 1, 2 or 3 dimensional periodicity

  - Unit cells with all possible 2D and 3D Bravais lattice systems 
    (i.e., cubic, orthorhombic, monoclinic, etc.) 

  - A companion matlab package
    [Polymer Visual](<https://github.com/kdorfmanUMN/polymer_visual/>)
    for visualization of structures with periodic boundary conditions

* **Features for SCFT on periodic systems (pscf_pc and pscf_pg):**

  - Efficient algorithms to find optimal unit cell parameters in SCFT

  - Imposition of any user-selected space-group symmetry on SCFT solutions

  - Built-in database of symmetry operations for all 230 3D space groups
    and 17 2D plane groups for use in SCFT

  - Inhomogeneous density constraint (a "mask")

  - External fields

  - Thin polymer films (implemented using a mask and external fields)

* **Features for PS-FTS (pscf_pc and pscf_pg):**

  - Brownian dynamics (BD) and Monte Carlo (MC) sampling 

  - BD algorithms: Leimkuhler-Matthews and predictor-corrector step
    algorithms

  - MC move algorithms: real-space and "smart"/force-bias moves 

  - Efficient new algorithms for adjusting the pressure field so as to 
    find a partial saddle-point (i.e., to impose incompressibility)

  - Tools for calculation of free energy differences by thermodynamic 
    integration, including the Einstein-crystal integration method

  - Parameter "ramps" in which one or more parameters change continuously
    during a simulation

  - Analysis tools to compute several quantities of interest, including
    the structure factor, order parameters used to identify phase 
    transitions, and derivatives of the Hamiltonian needed for 
    thermodynamic integration calculations

  - Analysis tools can applied either during a simulation or by
    postprocessing of field trajectory files
