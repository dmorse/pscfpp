Development of the C++/CUDA version of PSCF that is described in this 
manual began in 2015 as a project to rewrite an older Fortran program 
of the same name.  The Fortran version of PSCF is an SCFT program for 
incompressible liquids containing one or more species of linear block 
polymers and (optionally) one or more small molecule solvent species. 
The acronym PSCF stands for "Polymer Self-Consistent Field", reflecting 
this origin of the package as an SCFT program. 

The Fortran version of PSCF is maintained in a separate github.com 
repository at
<a href= https://github.com/dmorse/pscf/>https://github.com/dmorse/pscf</a> ,
but is no longer being actively developed. The name "pscfpp" that is 
used for the github repository containing the current version was 
chosen to avoid a clash with the name "pscf" that is used for the 
repository containing the older Fortran code.

The current C++/CUDA version of PSCF is intended to supersede the Fortran
version. The current version provides almost all of the capabilities of
the Fortran program, and some important new capabilities. New users of 
PSCF should use the current version documented here, and users of the 
Fortran version should consider switching to the current version
whenever they can.

<b> Features and advantages of current C++ version </b>:

Features of the current version of PSCF that distinguish it from the
legacy Fortran version include the following:
<ul>
  <li>
  The current version was designed as an extensible package of several 
  programs intended for different geometries, algorithms and/or computer
  hardware. The Fortran code is a single SCFT program designed for 
  periodic structures and linear polymers.
  </li>
  <li>
  The current version enables simulations of mixtures containing acyclic
  branched block polymers, in addition to the linear block polymers and
  linear homopolymers allowed by the Fortran code.
  </li>
  <li>
  The current version enables the use of graphics processing units (GPUs)
  to dramatically accelerate some applications.
  </li>
  <li>
  The current version enables partial-saddle point field theoretic 
  simulation (PS-FTS) calculations in addition to SCFT.
  </li>
</ul>

<b> Features unique to the legacy Fortran program </b>:

The following features of the legacy Fortran program have not been ported 
to the C++/CUDA version:
<ul>
  <li> The Fortran PSCF program provides a quasi-Newton-Broyden SCFT
       iteration algorithm that works very well for problems of modest 
       size.
  </li>
  <li> The Fortran PSCF program can perform RPA-like linear-reponse 
       calculations for ordered structures.
  </li>
</ul>
These two features are described in more detail below;

The Fortran PSCF program provided a unique quasi-Newton/Broyden SCFT 
iteration algorithm that was based on a physically motivated initial
approximation for the inverse Jacobian that is iteratively improved via 
a Broyden update algorithm.  This was an excellent algorithm for the 
problems of moderate size for which it was originally designed. It was 
abandoned in the new version in favor of a variety of Anderson-mixing 
algorithms because the amount of memory required by the Newton/Broyden
algorithm increases as the square of the number of spatial degrees of 
freedom (i.e., number of basis functions), which prevented the algorithm 
from being applied to larger problems.

The Fortran PSCF program has the ability to compute the linear response 
of a periodic structure to an infinitesimal inhomogeneous external field. 
This algorithm allowed description of limits of stability of ordered phases 
and of composition fluctuations within such phases. This feature has not been 
ported to the new C++ version, but will remain available within the legacy 
Fortran program, via the github repository for that program. The required 
algorithm and some application are described in the following reference:
