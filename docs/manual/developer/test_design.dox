 The unit test framework contains classes UnitTest, TestRunner, and
 CompositeTestRunner, and a class template named UnitTestRunner.

 UnitTest is a base class for classes that implement unit test methods.
 Each subclass of a UnitTest should have one or more member functions
 that implement tests. Each such test function should contain one or
 more assertions. Each assertion must be implemented using the the
 TEST_ASSERT(expression) macro to assert the truth of a logical
 expression. Files that define subclasses of UnitTest should include
 the files "UnitTest.h" and "UnitTestRunner.h".

 TestRunner is an abstract base class for classes that run test
 methods.  The run() method of a TestRunner runs a sequence of
 associated test methods. TestRunner is base class for the
 UnitTestRunner class template and for the class CompositeTestRunner.

 UnitTestRunner is a class template that takes a subclass of UnitTest
 as a template argument. The run() method of a UnitTestRunner runs all
 of the test methods of the associated UnitTest subclass. For example,
 UnitTestRunner<TestA>::run() runs all the test methods of a UnitTest
 subclass named TestA. The file UnitTestRunner.h contains a set of
 preprocessor macros that can be used to generate the code required
 to define an instantiation of UnitTestRunner and to register all of
 the test methods of the associated UnitTest.

 A CompositeTestRunner is a composite of two or more other TestRunner
 classes, each of which may be either an instantiation of UnitTestRunner
 or another CompositeTestRunner.

 More information about each class is given in the class documentation
 for the UnitTest, TestRunner, UnitTestRunner, and CompositeTestRunner.
